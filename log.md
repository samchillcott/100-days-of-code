# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: 31/3/20 Tuesday  

**Today's Progress**: I've got my head around the various ways of writing functions, the difference between expressions and declarations and how parameters and arguments interact with each other.

Basics, but I realised when doing a React tut recently I was following ok with the code (after all, you just copy essentially) but some sentences were going over my head so I decided to go back in on the terminology until I genuinely understood it

**Thoughts** I've prob already done around 100 hours of learning but excited to start this challenge. Also excited to get back to React with some solid JS fundamentals under my belt. I've always understood the meta concepts but now I get each part of the code a bit more
