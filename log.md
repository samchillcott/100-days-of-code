# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 31/3/20 Tuesday  

**Today's Progress**: I've got my head around the various ways of writing functions, the difference between expressions and declarations and how parameters and arguments interact with each other.

Basics, but I realised when doing a React tut recently I was following ok with the code (after all, you just copy essentially) but some sentences were going over my head so I decided to go back in on the terminology until I genuinely understood it

**Thoughts** I've prob already done around 100 hours of learning but excited to start this challenge. Also excited to get back to React with some solid JS fundamentals under my belt. I've always understood the meta concepts but now I get each part of the code a bit more

### Day 2: 1/4/20 Tuesday  

**Today's Progress**: Figured out all teh different ways to write functions. Leant how to convert functions to arrow functions (and revert).

**Thoughts** Glad I fully get this now. Name, parameters, statement, arguments all mean something to me now.

### Day 3: 2/4/20   

**Today's Progress**: ES6 Modules (Vanilla JS). Came across export default when using React and understood its function but not really the syntax - this seems to be a theme! Also looked at node.js module.exports.

**Thoughts** I knew going into frameworks would highlight some areas of JS I'd have to go back on so I'm glad I made notes while doing it (anything I didn't quite get while playing with React and Vue, I checked to see if it was Vanilla or the framework). Looking forward to getting back to React with this fundamental knowledge in place. Still a few (main) areas to go back to but will do them first.

### Day 4: 3/4/20   

**Today's Progress**: Classes, constructor functions, instances. The difference between objects and classes and what they are used for. Next week or so will be learning but will move back to tutorials and actual coding soon (what I was doing before I started the challenge).

**Thoughts** I now can see how OOP can be used in real life. Learning JS using online classes is cool but does sometimes lack the context of when and how the code would be useful. As with the last few days, I have had to backtrack a little but it's all good. It's lucky I love learning.

### Day 5: 4/4/20   

**Today's Progress**: Classes ctd using Codecademy. Inheritance, parent and child classes, super and extends keywords. Also went back and did Arrays section again as a refresher.

**Thoughts** I now can see how classes can save a lot of time and code = DRY. Another solid 3 hours of learning at the weekend. Love it.

### Day 6: 5/4/20   

**Today's Progress**: Getters and Setters. Didn't initially understand why we wouldn't just access the properties as usual but can now see the advantages of both and how they help with privacy/access etc. Also figured out why underscore was being used - naming convention to indicate the proprty shoudn't be altered

**Thoughts** Little tired today so only did an hour. Switched to less taxing learning and happy I still continued the streak. Also enjoying how whenever I dont 'get' something, I make a note, come back to it, do some research and within a day or so, I 'get' it. Reminds me not to get disheartened.

### Day 7: 6/4/20   

**Today's Progress**: 
- Factory functions - creating many instances of an object⁣
- Property value shorthand ⁣
- Destructuring - extracting key-value pairs from an object and assigning them to a variable⁣
- Browser compatibility - How some browsers cant work with ES6⁣
- Babel - a transpiler used to convert ES6 to ES5 to overcome above compatibility issues

**Thoughts** Good to finish off advanced objects section on Codecademy as this is where I got stuck when I first tried JS about 3 months ago. Confident I'll complete the course and comprehend most of it.

### Day 8: 7/4/20   

**Today's Progress**: 
Promises - My introduction to Asynchronous programming. An async operation is one that allows the computer to “move on” to other tasks while waiting for the asynchronous operation to complete.⁣
⁣
.setTimeout() - a Node API (a comparable API is provided by web browsers) that uses callback functions to schedule tasks to be performed after a delay. Has two parameters: a callback function and a delay in milliseconds.⁣
⁣
.then- a higher-order function— it takes two callback functions as arguments. We refer to these callbacks as handlers. When the promise settles, the appropriate handler will be invoked with that settled value.⁣
⁣
.catch() -  takes only one argument, onRejected. In the case of a rejected promise, this failure handler will be invoked with the reason for rejection. Using .catch() accomplishes the same thing as using a .then() with only a failure handler.⁣
⁣
Tip 1: Always go back an fill in your gaps of knowledge before you move on⁣
⁣
Tip 2: If at first you don't get a concept, stick with it until it clicks.⁣

**Thoughts** 
As with most of my JavaScript learning journey, I've understood the concepts pretty much right away but not always been able to fully comprehend the syntax. I now recognize that "annoyed/frustrated" feeling as part of the process and have proved to myself multiple times that after a couple of days, I finally get it.⁣
⁣
I was thinking of creating a measure called "Syntax Comprehension %" for myself.  I endeavour to understand what EVERY part of the code is doing in a particular block/section/concept.

### Day 9: 8/4/20   

**Today's Progress**: 
Promises - chaining and concurrency.⁣ Finished CA section.
⁣
- Chaining Multiple Promises - One common pattern we’ll see with asynchronous programming is multiple operations which depend on each other to execute or that must be executed in a certain order.⁣
⁣
This process of chaining promises together is called composition. Promises are designed with composition in mind. Promise composition allows for much more readable code than the nested callback syntax that preceded it.⁣
⁣
- Concurrency - To maximize efficiency we should use concurrency, multiple asynchronous operations happening together. With promises, we can do this with the function Promise.all().⁣

**Thoughts** 
I've been making notes on all the foggy areas and all the questions I have whilst working through the Codecademy Promises section and will consolidate that knowledge over the coming days before moving on to the next section.⁣ Glad I'm practicing what I preach.

### Day 10: 9/4/20   

**Today's Progress**: 
- Callback functions - spent today getting head around what the syntax does. ⁣
⁣
Be careful not to nest too many callbacks if you can help it, as this can lead to something called “callback hell”.⁣

**Thoughts** 
I plan to understand callbacks, then promises then async/await as that seems the logical order and that ties into when they were introduced into JavaScript as improvements on the previous iteration. I like my new approach of not bombing onto the next section without fully comprehending.

### Day 11: 10/4/20   ⁣
⁣
**Today's Progress**: Promises but nothing sticking and brain is not functioning properly due to lack of sleep. Started about 6 different videos but ended up staring blankly at the screen.⁣
⁣
Had a note to read about errors and handling (related to promises) so I read up on errors and the different types:⁣
- Syntax⁣
- Runtime⁣
- Logical⁣
- Latent ⁣
- Input/validation⁣
- Compilation⁣
⁣
**Thoughts** Don’t be afraid to switch to (unrelated) passive learning if you still want to use your study time. Keep it easy.  I switched to super passive note-taking so I can process properly over the coming days when my brain is back in the game. ⁣

### Day 12: 11/4/20   ⁣
⁣
**Today's Progress**: ⁣
- Execution context - an abstract concept of an environment where the Javascript code is evaluated and executed. Whenever any code is run in JavaScript, it’s run inside an execution context.⁣
- Execution Stack - helps the JavaScript engine to keep track of the order of execution.⁣
- Call stack - a data structure that uses the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle to temporarily store and manage function invocation (call).⁣
- Event Loop - has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, it will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it.⁣
- Web APIs - A set of functionalities that help us perform additional tasks that are difficult to be performed on the main (single) thread, provided by the browser.⁣
⁣
- I now understand what web APIs are and how they support the single thread JS runtime.⁣
- main resource - https://blog.sessionstack.com/how-javascript-works-event-loop-and-the-rise-of-async-programming-5-ways-to-better-coding-with-2f077c4438b5⁣
⁣
⁣
**Thoughts** ⁣
- Take care of your body/listen to your body. Wasn’t feeling 100% there mentally today so did some easy research and reading.⁣
- Catch and make notes of sentences/phrases/words you don’t really understand. These are ideal to tick off on days when you aren't fully charged.⁣
- I plan to do more CS stuff at some point to understand the workings of the machines. Helps to understand what is happening on a macro level.⁣

### Day 13: 12/4/20   

**Today's Progress**: 
- Node.JS - Learnt about what it is, where it is used and how it sits in terms of JS and popular stacks such as MEAN and MERN. By zooming out and looking at runtime environments, I understand the main use context for JS - something you don’t always get when learning via something like Codecademy. 
- I can also now see how Modules and npm now sit with JS and node so I have connected a few dots.
- Module is a file, package is a collection of files and has a package.JSON for the metadata that describes the file or directory)
- truthy falsy refresher - Mainly used to check if something is undefined, null etc Useful when writing conditionals.

**Thoughts** 
- Still had a low-level headache (possibly from hay fever) so took it easy again today. I’m still learning though and these “off topic” passive learning days often give aha moments. 
- I did consider having a day off/rest day but figured I’d do an hour and see how I felt.
- I’d like to become a full-stack dev at some point and am quite looking forward to trying some back end stuff.
- I know I haven’t done much “coding” (or building) since I started the challenge but will be getting back into it once I finish off CA and solidify some fundamentals.

#100DaysOfCode [14/100]⁣
⁣
### Day 14: 13/4/20   ⁣
⁣
**Today's Progress**⁣
- Promises - Read all my collated notes from the last few days and it is starting to make more sense.⁣
- Redid the Promises section on CA then got stuck at where an executor function sits with promises.⁣
- Main resource - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QO4NXhWo_NM⁣
⁣
**Thoughts** ⁣
- The “take it easy” learning I did over the last 2 days has helped me visualise what is happening in asynchronous programming so going back to the code, It makes way more sense as I can visualise “where” each part is going to/from.⁣
- Taking it steady mentally and physically and a good night’s sleep has fully recharged me and my focus for the week ahead. Listen to your body. ⁣
- I’m starting to see a theme in how I learn and the difference between understanding the abstract/meta concept (what is going on and why), the terminology(the words used to describe what is going on) and the syntax (used to execute the concept).

### Day 15: 14/4/20   ⁣
⁣
**Today's Progress**⁣
- Promises redo in CA - Making more sense than my initial run but still lots of questions (which I am making a note of).⁣
- Found a few videos that explained it visually which is what I needed.⁣
- .then placement - I was getting confused as to why sometimes .then would be tagged immediately after the main function and sometimes on the next line. Turns out both work, the latter making the code more readable. I initially thought these were utilizing different ways to use .then.⁣
- Tip - always make a note of parts of the course you don’t really get. Then come back to them at a later date and you may be pleasantly surprised it makes sense after you have done some more practice or study.⁣
⁣
**Thoughts** ⁣
⁣
- I’m sure promises could be better explained with animations (not just graphics or drawing arrows on whiteboards) but I can’t seem to find any anywhere. I kinda get what each part is doing individually but not how they all interact with each other and in what order (constructor, executor, promise, then, catch). ⁣
- I’m starting to get bored and frustrated with Promises. So tempted to move on to the next stage (async-await) or do something related instead. ⁣
- Think I will move on to Async Await and Requests soon so I can get some experience actually using Promises and AA (learning in context). I know a large amount of front end work can be about APIs and making requests (consuming promises) so I think the sooner I start actually playing with it, the quicker I can see the concept in action and learn it that way. If not, I can always roll back to the basics.⁣
- This is my first real “brick wall” that I have stayed to try and climb. The feeling sucks.

### Day 16: 15/4/20   

**Today's Progress**
- Promises - tried a few videos coding along and using the console. Still don’t really get what part is connecting to where, and why.
- reject and resolve when used in the promise constructor aren’t JS keywords, just a naming convention. I think that was where I was getting confused as the names of the functions kept changing and the lack of consistency threw me a little. One of my most used questions while learning JS is “Where is that coming from?”.
- CA Requests - decided to have a quick look to see if it helps to play with promises using real world examples.

**Thoughts** 
- As an HSP, tutorials with loud key banging irritate me.
- I’m really starting to get frustrated (and angry if I’m honest) but I know that’s part of the game. I’m just acknowledging it.
- I said yesterday I am “hitting a brick wall” and my friend, Alfred, said to  “define the brick wall as a specific question that could be answered specifically” so I have started to make a list. There are quite a few.
- I get why setTimeout is used in examples to show/create async but that syntax adds a layer (and a load of brackets) of confusion. Surely real world examples would be better?

### Day 17: 16/4/20   

**Today's Progress**
- Promises - Starting to see the wood from the trees. I think realising the split between promise creation and promise consumption helps. And knowing consuming APIs means you don’t have to create the promise just consume it.
- Async Await - Been saving this until I ‘get’ promises but it appeared in a tut and can see how it works. AA doesn't really change anything in the background, it still uses promises, it's just an easier way to write asynchronous code as synchronous = syntactic sugar.

**Thoughts** 
- I’m glad I’m sticking at it. I explained this to my work wife as “I know all the pieces of the jigsaw, I just don’t know how they fit together”. Today I fit a few of them together and realised I was previously trying to connect two pieces that were part of the same puzzle but didn’t fit together.
- The importance of having a mentor (or at least someone who can talk you through a concept or code) - I spent 2 hours going through Promises from scratch with @voyzan and now I am really starting to fit the jigsaw puzzle pieces together. Without that support I probably would have either spent another 3-4 days on it or moved onto another area. Don’t be afraid to “call in the big guns” if you can’t work it out yourself. 
- I am super grateful for all those who have offered support since I started this journey.

### Day 18: 17/4/20   

**Today's Progress**
- Promises - I’m slowly consolidating all yesterday’s learning and creating a simple guide so I can explain it to myself and others (the rubber duck technique).
- Constructing a promise - pretty much got this part now. Consuming is what I’ll figure next.

**Thoughts** 
- I don’t know if it is just how my brain works but this could have been explained way better by separating all the components of promises (creating - executor, promise object, and consuming - then catch etc), explaining how each part works individually then how they all interact with each other and in what order. Nothing I read/watched really did it this way., it just made it way more complicated than I think it needs to be imo. Separate the parts, put them in order.
- I woke up with a bit of a headache (which is rare for me) and my brain isn’t functioning at all today. I’m looking at the screen but nothing is going in, let alone comprehending it. My mental energy is low. Good sleep will sort me out I know. I have all my jigsaw pieces, just didn’t have the ability to play jigsaw today.

### Day OFF: 18/4/ 20  

**Today's Progress**
-N/A

**Thoughts** 
- This is the first full day off with no coding/learning in 2 months straight (including weekends). I’ve been managing ok just doing on average 2-3 hours per day but have had a few headaches lately which I misdiagnosed as hay fever or sunburn. My body (and a few friends and family) has been telling me to give it a break for a day or so. Today I actually did that and it feels good. Much needed. 
- Woke up with no alarm, walk in nature, no screens until I made a few zoom calls. Will chill for the rest of the evening.
- I wanted to do an entry because these days are still part of the process and sometimes get overlooked.
- I may even plan them going forward or keep powering through and listen to the signals more instead of ignoring them and thinking “I’ll just do this one last thing”.

### Day OFF: 19/4/20   

**Today's Progress**
- N/A

**Thoughts** 
- Another day off due to mild headache still. Realised it was from stress after I spotted a few other symptoms. Did a meditation where I named the emotion as overwhelm. There is so much to learn when it comes to programming. It’s an eagerness and impatience rather than dread or doubt. The pressure I have put on myself is showing up in my body/brain.
- Identify your cause of stress and acknowledge it. Don’t resist, surprises or fight the emotion.

### Day 19: 20/4/20   ⁣
⁣
**Today's Progress**⁣
- Objects and Classes - Had a chat with my mentor and decided to go back over some other fundamentals. Started using Khan Academy’s Intro to Objects.⁣
- The difference between initialisation and instantiation. Instantiation is where an object (class instance) is created, Initialisation is when you provide an initial value for a variable. ⁣
**Thoughts** ⁣
- I’m going to leave Promises for now and will come back to it shortly. I think I’m probably missing the “obvious” because there are a few gaps in my fundamentals - both in terms of concepts and terminology. I think when I come back to it, it will probably click.⁣
- I can definitely see the benefit of learning in a traditional setting (such as a school/bootcamp) as you have a route/syllabus and people on hand to answer any qs you have at the time. Learning online/solo can mean you skip over or miss bits more often unless you are hyper-aware and diligent.⁣
- I’m relaxing a little more in terms of pressure to “bag the hours” in a day.⁣
- Switching from 60-minute pomodoros to shorter sprints of 25-30 so I still do the same number of hours but have more breaks in between which is more sustainable.⁣
- I like the KA approach as it is the happy medium between Codecademy and YT tuts where you get exercises but also verbal explanations. It’s cool try different (styles of) resources as they all explain it different ways and some may click more than others depending on your learning style.⁣
- Called it a day after 2 hours (4x30 mins). I could do more but easing back into it.

### Day 20: 21/4/20   ⁣
⁣
**Today's Progress**⁣
- Classes - Refresher on the 2 ways to define a class: class keyword and .prototype⁣
- Prototype (and how it sits with JS Classes) - Came across this a while back and knew I would go deeper at some stage. ⁣
- JS classes (introduced in ES6/2015) are syntactical sugar over JS’ prototype-based inheritance.⁣
- JS is object-oriented rather than class-based⁣
⁣
**Thoughts** ⁣
- OOP - I’ve covered a few areas of OOP and how it is used In JS and now I’m starting to connect a few dots and it is all slowly starting to click.⁣
- Pomodoros - Enjoying the new 30 min sprints.

### Day 21: 22/4/20   ⁣
⁣
**Today's Progress**⁣
- Constructor function - consolidated my notes and now comprehend what it does and where it sits with classes (and promises - which I will revisit soon). Also figured out how this gets used in a constructor: “The name property of this object is equal to whatever gets passed into the constructor function” (the argument passed in is the value/second part of the key-value pair). ⁣
- Object Inheritance + prototype chain - first look. Will go in over the next day or so.⁣
⁣
**Thoughts** ⁣
- I’m feeling strangely scared of returning to promises because I know if it still doesn’t click, I’ll get pissed off again. Kind of a dilemma - to progress to AA and requests I will have to go at promises again but if I do and I get annoyed again, I’ll lose motivation and momentum (albeit temporarily).⁣
- I wish I would have started with FreeCodeCamp from day 1. Hindsight is a wonderful thing but although CA looks aesthetically cooler and the free version (without the projects) can probably be completed quicker (after all it is an “Introduction to” JS), FCC does seem more comprehensive and complete.

### Day 22: 23/4/20   

**Today's Progress**
- Prototype - more learning on what they are.
- When to use prototype - If you plan to have more than one object that will share a method, you should place that method(s) on a prototype of those objects (general rule)
- Why use prototype - 1. DRY coding - not repeating the method across multiple objects 2. Ability to manipulate a single object for multiple instances (make a change and affect several objects at once). 3. Reduce memory requirements.
- Array methods - I now know why these methods are accessible (built-in) because each new array is a new instance of Array which has access to the Array.prototype.

**Thoughts** 
- Going somewhat off topic but prototypical inheritance is the basis of JS and it was on my list of things to learn anyway.
- Having a better understanding of creating objects/instances will help me when I go back to promises.
- I rested well yesterday and feel almost human again. I think the stress was preventing me catching up on my sleep debt.

### Day 23: 24/4/20   ⁣
⁣
**Today's Progress**⁣
- Promises - Tried FCC ES6 section. Easy. Wtf. Lol. Re did CA promises again and it's making way more sense now.⁣
- Turning syntax into words - For example, = () => {  translates to⁣
“is/a function/that does/this bit of code”. This little tip helps me decipher and create syntax a little easier now.⁣
⁣
**Thoughts** ⁣
- I still don’t 100% get exactly what each part of the syntax is doing/how it works with each other (I do get the general principle and the terminology) but I am moving on. I have spent possibly too long trying to ‘get’ something which is rather small in the grand scheme of things (and now superseded by async-await anyway). I think heading back to building and requests may help this finally click. I’m allowing myself to leave this temporarily knowing it will come back in the future (how ironic) and by then, I’ll have a better grasp of what is going on.⁣
- I think I was struggling because I didn’t have full comprehension of creating objects, object composition and using functions as arguments (functions within functions). Surely these are basics though right? Yeah, and I ‘got’ them at the time I first came across them which was weeks ago, but just forgot them. So it shows you can ‘know’ the stuff but until it is drilled into your memory, you will struggle.⁣
- Monitor tiredness - I think it’s safe to say if I am shouting and swearing at code then I’m tired and it’s time to leave it for the day. When I have full capacity it’s more of a “hmm, what’s happening there?” thought in my head.

### Day 24: 25/4/20   ⁣
⁣
**Today's Progress**⁣
- React and a return to frameworks - Doing another React tut for 3 reasons. 1 - I’m bored of promises and want to do something more fun/exciting to keep momentum up. 2 - it will highlight the fundamentals I still need to learn. 3 - refresh my knowledge of frameworks which I started before this challenge.⁣
- React refresh - Really get what components and props are now. Other areas which are now familiar include modules/import/export, destructuring, methods and dot notation.⁣
⁣
**Thoughts** ⁣
- Going back to my React notes from a month ago, I see I was struggling with terminology and the “talk of objects and classes still kinda confuses me”. Not any more, the last month of drilling the basics has really helped. I can understand most of what a basic react app is doing including most of the syntax. ⁣
- I do actually enjoy learning theory but have missed actually tinkering and playing about (actually coding) and getting realtime feedback.⁣
- Having my google doc notes, a YT tut, localhost/live server and VS code open on a MacBook Air 11 is a bit of a struggle. Will be looking at getting a second screen once I settle down next. The 11” has served me amazingly well for travel and coaching but is less practical for (long hours of) coding.

### Day 25: 26/4/20   ⁣
⁣
**Today's Progress**⁣
- State in React - setting and changing state and toggling between states using ternary operators.⁣
- .map - Could do with a refresher on iterators⁣
- Pushing to GitHub using VSCode - creating and syncing repos using the terminal. Getting head around remote and local repos and how to connect the code on your machine to the repo online.⁣
- Git terminology: ⁣
	- Stage = “Ready”⁣
	- Commit = “Set”⁣
	- Push = “Go”⁣
⁣
**Thoughts** ⁣
- Steady day but happy to be back in React.⁣
- The connection between Git, GitHub, GitHub Desktop and VSCode was something I hadn't got my head around until today. As someone with mild OCD, it’s nice to know what is being saved where.⁣
- As much as I like GUIs, I think in this case, it will be better for me in the long term to be comfortable doing git commands in the terminal.

**Today's Progress**⁣
- React using visual metaphors - An IG post by @angelaa.dev I read yesterday mentioned using metaphors to explain React. The metaphors and visuals are by @maggieappleton and they are amazing. Link below:⁣
- https://bit.ly/2S9mi4u⁣
- Started Dev Ed Recipe app tut which incorporates React, API requests (using async-await) and useEffect.⁣
- Hooks - They let you use state and other React features without writing a class. 	If you’re familiar with React class lifecycle methods, you can think of useEffect Hook as componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount combined.⁣
- async-await - The syntax and logic here looks straight forward. Although I still haven’t fully got my head around promises (what actually goes on under the hood), on the surface, async-await looks way easier to comprehend.⁣
- Emmet for React in VSCode - imr gives you “ import React from ‘react’ “ and exp gives you “ export default “. Love a bit of Emmet. If you don’t know about it, go check it out to save you many, many keystrokes.⁣
⁣
**Thoughts** ⁣
- As Maggie mentions in her slides, a lot of programming is explained in walls of text which doesn’t always help, especially if people have different learning preferences. What Maggie does is something I was crying out for when I was learning promises.⁣
- No Wireless - I’m experimenting to see if the Bluetooth on my new headphones is what is causing/contributing to my mild headaches so I’m using the cable. It may also be from the headphones gripping my head or even the ANC so am monitoring different combos.

### Day 27: 28/4/20   ⁣
⁣
**Today's Progress**⁣
- npm start - Spent a while trying to start up yesterdays tut. Still don’t really get npm and folder structure enough to figure out why it won’t start. Something to do with not finding the package.json. Deleted a bunch of files and folders and probably made it worse.⁣
- Created a new app from scratch and copied the code back in. Good practice to get used to setting up React. Also noted last creation I neglected to add the . to create-react-app which could have caused an issue.⁣
- State - change the state object to change how the app looks. If anything in the state changes, the app should refresh to reflect that new reality. This is what React does when state is changed: it re-renders the entire app.⁣
- I fully get about 75% of the mechanics of this app so it has highlighted some grey areas (where I get what is going on but not the syntax and exactly what is happening under the hood). So..⁣
- Vanilla areas to brush up on - doing a few React tuts has highlighted a few (minor) areas to learn a bit more about such as .map, spread operator, async-await and events & handlers.⁣
- React areas to brush up on - props, hooks (state, effect, ref) and keys/UUID.⁣
⁣
**Thoughts** ⁣
- I’m quite organised when it comes to data organisation and it irks me not knowing what should go where and having files that can be deleted that take up space.⁣
- I’m slowly comprehending all the lines of code in a basic react app. Doing a few more tutorials and some reading on the areas to brush up on (mentioned above) should get me to a decent level of understanding and prep me for creating my own (basic) app I can use for my portfolio.⁣
- Another good day in the bag. Not box.

### Day 28: 29/4/20   ⁣
⁣
**Today's Progress**⁣
- Reading up on state in React. ⁣
- Hooks Traversy tut - Hooks enable state to be used in functional components. Previously you had to use a class component to manage state and functional components were “stateless components”.⁣
⁣
**Thoughts** ⁣
- I quite like the idea that these languages evolve. The new features that get added can potentially be a pain to learn but I think it by far outweighs the pain of doing things the old way. All the features are there to make our life easier so bring it on.⁣
- Found some old notes of mine and found the react snippets exertion for VS Code shortcuts. rfc will create boilerplate for react functional component, takes name from name of file + includes import react. ⁣
- ES7 React/Redux/GraphQL/React-Native Snippets Extension⁣
- I thought the Traversy vid would be more dialogue but turned out to be another todo app tut. Decided to do it as doing is usually a better way to learn. The same grey areas are cropping up again but will brush up over the next few days.⁣
- Yet another Todo app but I can see how these are great practice for adding, updating and removing elements.

### Day 29: 30/4/20   ⁣
⁣
**Today's Progress**⁣
- Traversy hooks/Todo App - Finished off app and uploaded to GH using just the terminal and not GH desktop.⁣
- Grey areas - Quite a few small parts of the code I still don’t 100% get so starting to work through my “To Learn” list.⁣
- Persistent data - Stored in actual format and stays there versus in-memory where you have it once, close the file and it’s gone. You can retrieve persistent data again and again. In these app tuts, we are not persisting the data - it isn’t getting stored in a database anywhere or local storage.⁣
- Keys in React lists - Keys help React identify which items have changed (added/removed/re-ordered). To give a unique identity to every element inside the array, a key is required. ⁣

**Thoughts** ⁣
- Forms - @Vickysdailystandup suggested I get good at forms which are a large part of websites. I could do with a refresher as I kinda sped through basic HTML many months ago.⁣
- Prediction - One thing I enjoyed when learning CSS and following tuts was to pause the tut and check the reference/final code (on live server) and try and predict how to re-create that section of the layout before they run through it on the vid. I’m struggling to know where to start when it comes to JS so that’s highlighting my current level. Reminds me of my Spanish language ability - I can understand about 90% of the content when it is given to me (listening or reading) but when it comes to proactively creating content (speaking) I can only do about 50%. ⁣
- Local storage - I always had the question “what happens to all the data we fill out or submit? Where does it go?”. As I’m getting closer to learning backend it is slowly starting to make sense. When I first came across DOM manipulation I thought it was pointless as it gets reset each time. Now I have a basic grasp of databases and local storage, I can see what can happen with our data/events.⁣
- I was always curious why my Prettier extension wasn’t working. Turns out since I’ve been using live server extension (which updates automatically without the need to manually save) I haven’t been manually saving (cmd S) as much so it's nice to see wonky indentations and bulks of text become nice and neat.

### Day 30: 1/5/20   

**Today's Progress**
- DOM refresher - Now I’ve done a fair bit of JS and OOP I understand what the DOM is and how we can use it way more than when I actually learned DOM manipulation a few months back. 
- Virtual DOM - further understanding of what is happening under the hood. The virtual DOM makes 2 copies of the original DOM. When something gets updated, it compares the 2 virtual copies, finds where the update was and then updates the appropriate node/part of the original DOM.
- Pre-React (or when not using a similar system) if one thing changed on a page, the whole page (as opposed to a component within the page) needed a re-render which was slower.
- Its more that the updating and rendering of the DOM is inefficient, not necessarily the DOM itself.
- Root - document.getElementById('root') - root is the root html element of the DOM tree. getElementByID() is a method on the document object.

**Thoughts** 
- There is a part of me that always wants to understand every element of every concept but sometimes I just don't need to know to progress. I could learn it but it will slow my journey progress down. I'd like to catch a remind myself to leave it and I can come back if I need to. Most of the time I don't!
- OOP - I can see how the transition from CSS to JS is a big shock for many (myself included). Even dabbling in basic JS functionality on a site involves concepts such as OOP which make no sense at the time. What is this dot? What is a document? What’s with the brackets? etc.
- I definitely prefer visuals/metaphors to explain the concepts
Involved in programming.
- Verbose - One of the videos I watched said that React was verbose (using or expressed in more words than are needed = more code) which is exactly what I picked up on early on. “Seems a loot of code to do such simple things” but they explained that doing it this way is beneficial because it forces you to think through everything so when you come back to it a month later you can understand what you wrote.
- .txt > .rtf - I've been using mac's TextEdit app to write these notes but was getting annoyed with crazy formatting when I would paste in stuff. Converting to .txt (make rich text) has solved that issue. And it feels like I am in the terminal!

**Questions**
- Are the things we import at the top (React and ReactDOM) objects, functions or both?
- Is the ReactDOM that we import the virtual DOM? (Pretty sure this is the case). Or is the virtual DOM part of the React import? 
- How do the 3 main objects work together? (document/DOM, react and react DOM)

### Day 31: 2/5/20   ⁣
⁣
**Today's Progress**⁣
- Array methods/Iterators refresh using CA. These are built into JS.⁣
- .forEach() - will execute the same code for each element of an array. ⁣
- .map() - Used often in React. works in a similar manner to .forEach()— the major difference is that .map() returns a new array.⁣
- .filter() - returns an array of elements after filtering out certain elements from the original array. The callback function for the .filter() method should return true or false depending on the element that is passed to it. The elements that cause the callback function to return true are added to the new array.⁣
- .findIndex() - calling it on an array will return the index of the first element that evaluates to true in the callback function.⁣
- .reduce() method returns a single value after iterating through the elements of an array, thereby reducing the array⁣
⁣
**Thoughts** ⁣
- Sunny Saturday so decided to take on something pretty chill.⁣
- Still don't get the .map code when it is used in React. Will have to gen up on keys, indexes, destructuring and iterating in JSX which was the plan anyway.⁣
- Use it or lose it - I've covered so much over the last 4 months that there is no way I can contain it all in memory. As I am not regularly working with what I am learning either via a job or project, a lot of it falls away over time. This isn't a problem per se as I can easily read my notes and it will come back instantly but I can see the importance of using what you learn until it becomes muscle memory.⁣
- Headaches - I took a week off from my wireless headphones and was still getting super mild, but constant headaches. I have made a list of suspects that are causing them and my next one to check is eye strain caused by increased mobile phone usage. I engage a lot with the IG dev community and cheer on others doing this challenge but I notice I do hold my screen quite close to my face. Will monitor for the next few days. They aren't painful but more of a pressure/tension in the muscles on the scalp (as opposed to something that feels like its hurting the brain itself like a migraine would).⁣
⁣
**Questions**⁣
- Do iterators always have to return (use the return keyword)? CA ones do, react/JSX ones don't seem to.

### Day 32: 3/5/20   

**Today's Progress**
- Destructuring - extract data from an object and assign to new distinct variables aka destructured assignment. 
- Destructuring in React - keeps components cleaner and easier to understand. Provides a more concise way to write your props. Most of the React components you see in the wild will not take an argument called “props”. Instead, they use ES6’s destructuring syntax to pull the values out of the props object. This saves you from having to write props.whatever all over the place, and makes it clear, right up top, which props this component expects.
- There are 2 ways to destructure props in a functional component. 1 - in the function parameter itself. 2 - in the function body.

**Thoughts** 
- I think one needs to fully understand props in React before destructuring fully makes sense. 
- I like that feeling when I have scattered notes and consolidate them all into one section.
- Headaches - I don't think it's from the noise cancelling headphones, I think its from clenching my jaw (done unconsciously while awake and asleep due to stress - bruxism). I think maybe doing more meditation may reduce the root cause.

### Day 33: 4/5/20   

**Today's Progress**
- Rendering - React DOM takes care of updating the DOM to match the React elements and only gets imported in the index.js file. It is a library on an object and has a render function. Think of it as taking your html file (file loads in the browser), finding element id root (.render() called) and replacing it with everything that is inside app (find and replace).
- export default can be done just before the function or at the bottom of the file. There is no difference, pick one and stay consistent. I prefer at the bottom of the file (rfce as opposed to rfc using snippets).
- Destrucuring in action - I can now spot both array and object destructuring in the code and understand why this is used.
- Props - All of our components are going to have props that we can pass to them and we pass them just like we pass attributes to an html element <TodoList todos={todos}/>. Starting to see what is getting passed where and what is being done within each component. I'm starting to make sense of the code itself, not just the meta concept.

**Thoughts** 
- Doing is probably the best way to learn. Rather than read about some of the inner workings of React, I thought doing another tut (which will no doubt demonstrate the concept I am unsure about) would help put that learning in context and give me something to show for the learning. I want to be building more and getting into that habit.
- Noticeable progress - Revisiting my questions and notes from the last few React tuts and I can now answer a lot of the questions I had. It is a cool way to measure progress and validation on the hours spent trying to get head around concepts.
- Stick to the main concepts - I almost started today looking at keys in react and I would have spent a good 2-3 hours understanding why they are used and how. However, in the grand scheme of things, that didn't seem like an efficient use of time. I'm now catching myself when I "go in on" comparatively small concepts for a large amount of time. Worry about those "smaller" details if/when I need them - and I don't necessarily have to know everything about them, just how to implement to get the app working.
- I wish someone would animate what is going on in terms of component interaction, state and props (data flow). I get it now but again, it could have been explained so much easier with an animation.
- Another ToDo list - buuut it's cool to see how different tuts approach them and if I keep hammering them (with some studying on the grey areas alongside), eventually it will all click. 
- Today's tut was called "React in 30 mins" - I spent 2.5 hours getting to 12 mins in to the video. I'm thoroughly comprehending each stage now though.

### Day 34: 5/5/20   

**Today's Progress**
- useRef - React hook that allows us to reference elements inside of our html eg the todo item text.
- Spread operator - … put in front of an array or an iterable object where we want to spread the array into its individual components. Kinda like taking the peas out of the pod.
- UUID (universally unique identifier) - library that creates random keys so they don't get duplicated/repeated. React likes to know which key/item (in a list for example) to update otherwise it will update the whole list which is less efficient.
- Side Effect - A "side effect" is anything that affects something outside the scope of the function being executed. These can be, say, a network request, which has your code communicating with a third party (and thus making the request, causing logs to be recorded, caches to be saved or updated, all sorts of effects that are outside the function). Functions that execute without side effects are called "pure" functions: they take in arguments, and they return values. Nothing else happens upon executing the function.
- useEffect - Reach hook that lets you perform side effects in function components. In this case it was to persist the data across page reload by using local storage (and JSON).
- In react, you should never modify a state variable, you should always create a copy before modifying it and use that copy to set the new state.	

**Thoughts** 
- Importance of documentation - Installing UUID like in the tut caused a compilation error (mainly because it is from October 2019). I checked my notes from last time I had this issue in a previous tut and tried that way which also didn't work. Remembered to check the actual documentation in npm and the answer was right there. Obviously. Go to the source.
- Too many VSCode extensions - As much as I love indent rainbow, I had to disable it because there was just too much going on in complex (for me) areas of code and the colours (along with bracket colorizer) were actually a visual hindrance.
- I definitely prefer tutorials where the instructor is engaging and amusing. My personal fav is Dev Ed (@developedbyed).

### Day 35: 21/5/20   ⁣
⁣
**Today's Progress**⁣
- Revisiting old React projects - checking I get the code and pushing to GH.⁣
- git push -u origin master - will push your changes to the remote server. "master" refers to master branch in your repository. master is the default local branch in GIT. Origin refers to the source repository from where it was cloned.⁣
- <React.StrictMode> StrictMode is a tool for highlighting potential problems in an application. Like Fragment, StrictMode does not render any visible UI. It activates additional checks and warnings for its descendants.⁣
⁣
**Thoughts** ⁣
- The first react tut I did (over a month ago) was React JS Crash Course by Traversy. When going back to the code today I can already see how much React has changed since this tut was made (Jan 3 2019). For example, class components instead of function components (with state), no use of useState hooks for state, importing PropTypes, component did mount etc instead of useEffect hooks, a lot of this., no/minimal destructuring, (promises instead of async await). A lot of the practices have now been replaced and I'm quite chuffed I can spot them. I'm also not surprised I got rather confused as some of it is quite long-winded. But getting confused here helped me understand OOP and dot notation a lot better. I love how languages and code are always evolving to make more efficient syntax and processes. Obviously the "old" code is still relevant as not all code bases will be using the latest so it has been good to see it in action and see how I could potentially do it "better".⁣
- Revisiting a tut I did a week ago which was more modern (Dev Ed Recipe API), I can understand about 90% of the code now. Made a note of the 10% I don't quite get fully and brushed up. ⁣
- Spent 2 hours with my mentor @voyzan where we went over the 10%, covered recent topics, learnt new ones and plotted my next steps. I love having these check-ins because it helps measure my progress, I get access to a wealth of knowledge and experience and I get excited each time I leave with a new list of things to learn/build. And the theme over the coming weeks will be building.⁣
- Headaches - Still a super mild tension (not enough to affect my mood or desire/ability to work). Next culprit to test is extended use on mobile where I hold the phone close to my face. Could be eye strain so will lower phone/IG use over the coming days.

⁣
### Day 36: 7/5/20 ⁣
⁣
**Today's Progress**⁣
- Tidying up Dev Ed Recipe React App⁣
- "React Hook useEffect has a missing dependency" - Had a go a trying to solve this compilation warning but couldn't so took the advice of the terminal and added // eslint-disable-next-line. This kinda solved it but the development build is not optimised. ⁣
- Some CSS blocks not working on app.css but think it was just because I hadn't saved! Cmd S on the regular from now on.⁣
- Tried to add a function to round up the calories number and succeeded. {{calories} = Math.round(calories)}.⁣
- Rearranged the recipe card layout.⁣
- “?” in URL - acts as a separator, it indicates the end of URL resource path and the start of query parameters. For GET request types, the query parameters are appended in URL itself and hence to differentiate the URL path and parameters “?” symbol is used.⁣
- fetch() - Fetch API was introduced around the same time as JavaScript ES6. It is a much cleaner API as opposed to the old XMLHttpRequest (XHR). The simplest use of fetch() takes one argument — the path to the resource you want to fetch — and returns a promise containing the response (a Response object). The response object is just an HTTP response, not the actual JSON. To extract the JSON body content from the response, we use the .json() method. ⁣
- Cloned a repo to my machine using VSCode for the first time. ⁣
⁣
**Thoughts** ⁣
- I like tweaking existing code to add new features and to style it to my liking. Obviously the main legwork has already been done but eventually, I'd like to be able to build from scratch without a tut to follow.⁣
- I've always been that guy who sends in feature requests so I'm excited to potentially have the ability to create these new features myself (or even my own app with those features) without having to wait/hope the company creates the feature.⁣
- Understand the importance of committing each tweak individually. I committed a few at a time then realised I'd messed something up and took me a while to find which line of code was causing it and rollback.⁣
- Grasp of CSS layouts and positioning - been a while since I've played with CSS so struggling to remember grid and flex solutions and then how to make the content sit nicely in the card. I like uniformity so would like to master the skills here. Working out how I want it to look like first, then working backwards from there is my approach.⁣
- I think as the components are sometimes individually styled it makes it ever so slightly more complicated than having one main .css file.⁣
- Displaying API data - as with the above, I'd like to be able to display what I am fetching from the API in a well-styled manner because I shall be doing a lot of API work over the coming weeks.⁣
- First look at fetch - can see it is a method that can be/is usually used in conjunction with either Promises or Async Await. I still haven't gone in on AA but will do soon.

### Day 37: 8/5/20 

**Today's Progress**
- .fetch() - Codecademy exercise on GET requests using promises: setting them up and also working with the info returned with the promise.
- fetch POST Requests - the initial call takes two arguments: an endpoint and an object that contains information needed for the POST request (settings object). The rest of the request is identical to the GET request.

**Thoughts** 
- Codecademy Requests module has 2 sections (AJAX/XHR and ES6/fetch/Async). Old me would have spent a while on section 1 but I decided to start with section 2 as it is more relevant and efficient. I'm teaching myself to learn "just in time" and to be happy missing out parts instead of trying to tick everything off the list. I can always come back IF I need it.
- Finally seeing how api, fetch api, async, promises and react all sit together.
- Promises - As annoying as it is (my OCD is wanting to be able to compartmentalise all of the code blocks), I like the challenge of following the data flow with all these callbacks, functions within functions and .thens. I would probably be better drawing it out rather than trying to picture it all in my head.
- F@@king () and {} everywhere. I wonder if there is an extension which can colour code blocks, not just the brackets? Maybe a background colour and the keywords/text still get their normal colours.
- It is nice to know some of requests is using boilerplate code. Makes it a bit more uniform and easier to learn.
- My head physically hurts from today's learning. I hate promises and chaining! I'm looking forward to Async Await that makes this whole process/syntax much easier.

### Day 38: 9/5/20 

**Today's Progress**
- async GET and POST requests on CA. Practice with API docs, endpoints and query parameters.
- async await - ES8. The async await syntax is syntactic sugar— it doesn’t introduce new functionality into the language, but rather introduces a new syntax for using promises and generators. Both of these were already built in to the language.

**Thoughts** 
- Black box - Don't worry about having to know what goes on inside the black box, just know how and when to use it and enjoy the abstraction and the fact you don't really have to know.
- Have enjoyed looking at endpoints and can see the potential to do some interesting stuff with requests.
- I love AA, its not the concept of promises I didn't like, just the bloated, Russian doll type syntax of the pre ES8 days.
- "View solution" in CA gives you the answers to the whole exercise instead of the specific question within the exercise. "Stuck on question 1? Ok we'll give you the answers for questions 2-12 as well!" NO, ffs. Needless to say I have sent a feature request.
- Feel confident in all the frontend stuff I've learned so far, next week I'll start a project that implements that knowledge.

⁣
**Today's Progress**⁣
- N/A⁣
⁣
**Thoughts** ⁣
- Well-timed ("finished" CA JS syllabus and knew I wanted a day watching UFC) and well-earned break. Doing stuff I enjoy and some physical exercise out in the countryside. Not watching or reading anything learning-based. Feel relaxed and energized for the next phase.⁣
- I do miss playing football. I don't need the motivation to play, I look forward to it. With running, I enjoy it when I'm out there with the music on but it takes a bit more internal convincing to kit up and go sometimes. Especially after a few hours of coding.

### Day 39: 11/5/20 ⁣
⁣
**Today's Progress**⁣
- Project planning - Sorting notes, creating a document and plan of attack.⁣
- Registered with API account and got key.⁣
- Read documentation.⁣
- Initialised React App.⁣
- Started development. ⁣
- MVP components - Components need to be Capitalized.⁣
- Set up getWeather function and set to imperial/Celsius.⁣
- Created data table for what I need to display.⁣
⁣
**Thoughts** ⁣
- Excited by building but a little nervous about doing it "on my own" but I know it is the best way to learn and I can always follow a template from a similar tutorial if need be.⁣
- I'm already thinking of extra features I can add to demonstrate other areas of knowledge and utilise other libraries or code but I want to keep it simple at the moment and get an MVP up and running. The icing can come later.⁣
- Trying to do as much of this as I can on my own without having to refer to the Recipe app which I can easily refactor.⁣
- Spent an abnormal amount of time selecting the "best" images to use as backgrounds. Reminded myself to keep to MVP - get it up and running first then tweak later. Any image will do!⁣
- I could spend a few days trying this on my own but why not just go straight to the template and refactor the recipe App. I'm ok with doing this because I understand all the code and why build from scratch if I don't have to. Efficiency. The more apps I make, the less I will need to refer to a template.⁣
- When building yourself you encounter errors you wouldn't get following a tut. This forces you to debug (by googling and using console) on your own which is great practice.⁣
- Even if you use a template, you still need to make sure it all fits and works together with your imported code. It's not just a simple copy and paste when it comes to apps. Understanding code blocks helps (a few missing closing brackets caused my first few errors).⁣
- Stripped it back to just get the weather component showing in the app. ⁣
- Can focus for longer because I'm excited by building/solving and it is less mentally taxing than learning a new concept.

### Day 40: 12/5/20 

**Today's Progress**
- Grabbing data from retrieved object to display in the component.

**Thoughts** 
- Struggled to connect my returned object to views.
- Struggled to connect and access subsets (objects within the fetched object) to views.
- Realised I didn't need .map as I am only fetching 1 object, not multiple hits like in the recipe app.
- I must be missing something obvious (to the trained eye). The object is there, I just can't access the parts I want without getting an error.
- I feel like watching (not following) a weather API app would be cheating but I have spent a few hours trying to display the data and can't figure out why some of it isn't showing. In the real world, there is no cheating, it's "what have other people done to get this working?" and then use that data to get yours working. I'm going to do this tomorrow, I've given it a good shot on my own today. Spending more time going round in circles will be inefficient.
- It is dawning on me how much I can't understand what the error messages are saying. This will be good practice for debugging. The clues are there, I just can't understand them all yet.
- My first real frustrating session. 2-3 hours on one bug and still not solved. Sure there will be more times like this in the future and this is my first taste. Sucks balls.

**Questions**
- Why is temp={weather.main.temp} giving this error "Cannot read property 'temp' of undefined"? 
- If I change it to temp={weather.temp} it doesn't give an error (it should imo because .temp isn't a direct property on the weather object) but also doesn't display anything in the component?

### Day 41: 13/5/20 ⁣
⁣
**Today's Progress**⁣
- Play with React dev tools in chrome and can see most of my props in the Weather component are undefined (except for city) so it looks like the object works, the variables are set up ready but the data I need isn't getting passed to the component correctly atm.⁣
- Watched a weather app tut to find how they were displaying their data and found a workaround (typeof ternary operator) which explained the errors I was getting yesterday. I can now access all parts of the response and have my data displaying within the component. I now have an MVP.⁣
- Learnt what Unix time was (how sunrise and sunset data is measured in the open weather API).⁣
- Unix time is the number of seconds that have elapsed since the Unix epoch, which is the time 00:00:00 UTC on 1 January 1970. It's most commonly used to create a running total of seconds when interacting with computers.⁣
- Got Unix into time format but is an hour out due to BST.⁣
⁣
**Thoughts** ⁣
- I spent most of yesterday in a mood because I was stumped with the app progress. I'd like to be able to detach my mental state from the coding sessions in the future. ⁣
- I still kinda feel like I'm cheating but I also know by copying, I am still learning.⁣
- I don't exactly get some of the code I am bringing in but at the end of the day, the app works. I know later down the line I'll understand the code though.⁣
- I like how I am taking/copying parts of code from different sources. It means it takes a bit more effort than following one tut because you have to get the parts to fit and work together. It also reminds me of my music production days and sampling from multiple sources to create my own finished product.⁣
⁣
**Questions**⁣
- Seems a long ass process to convert Unix to a readable time, wonder if there is a library to do this?

### Day 42: 14/5/20 ⁣
⁣
**Today's Progress**⁣
- Error handling in the search. Failed attempt.⁣
⁣
**Thoughts** ⁣
- I'm feeling a little sensation in my chest from nerves. I don't have the knowledge to do a lot of this. I can read JS quite well now but when it comes to creating my own code, I really feel I am lacking. I feel like a fraud if I'm honest. Although I know this feeling is natural/common.⁣
- I'm really feeling an avalanche of overwhelm today. I'm humbled with how much I can't do on my own. It's all good, I know I'll get there but can sense frustration that I'm not there yet.⁣
- I can write out the logic and theory for this app no problem but when it comes to coding it, I am struggling. This is where rocking with tutorials too much (being passive) is catching up with me.⁣
- I've always enjoyed optimising other people's work more than creating my own.⁣
- This is the first time "riding without the stabilisers" and it is while I am doing complex mountain trails. I never tried when I was riding 20m on a flat road with no traffic about.
- Mentor meet helped me mentally and also some tips around breaking code down, using comments and an introduction to debugging. It did dawn on me yesterday that I don't have a feedback loop because I can't understand what happens even when I do add code/get errors sometimes.
- Tough day but tomorrow is another day.

### Day 43: 15/4/20 

**Today's Progress**
- Error and Exception handling - Whether you hear people talking about Exceptions or Errors, in JavaScript they refer to the same thing. Error is a "you broke the law" shout and Exception is an "Almost there!" pad on the shoulder.
- Error object - When an error occurs, JavaScript generates an object containing the details about it. The object is then passed as an argument to catch. For all built-in errors, the error object has two main properties: Name - Error name. For instance, for an undefined variable that’s "ReferenceError" & Message - Textual message about error details.
- Basic debugging - including syntax errors. To me there are 4 parts: 1. Deciphering the error message (what is wrong in human language terms?) 2. Finding out why that is occurring. 3. Finding out where that is occurring within the code. 4. Updating the code to resolve the issue.
- Debugging (in chrome dev tools) - more efficient than adding and removing console.logs all over your code to find where it is not working.
- Breakpoint - "pause execution of the application here so I can do some inspection."

**Thoughts** 
- Looked into debugging to give me some skills on how to iterate the code I am creating. I haven't had a feedback loop recently so I didn't know where I was going wrong (without having someone check). I want to get to a stage where I can problem solve on the fly. TRY some code, if it doesn't work, understand why and what is happening, iterate until it does work. Without knowing why the code doesn't work you are confined to throwing randomness at a wall and seeing what sticks which is inefficient and quite frankly demoralising.
- I didn't sleep enough last night so my enthusiasm and tolerance are pretty low today so just taking it steady and avoiding anything that could potentially piss me off (my project. Ha).
- Having a bit more knowledge of errors and debugging has given me the confidence to TRY my code. Before I was scared to even write it in VSCode because even if it was wrong, I had minimal idea why, so I couldn't progress.

### Day 44: 16/5/20 

**Today's Progress**
- Set up chrome debugging in VSCode - I like the idea of being able to adjust the code as you debug. (Yes you can do it by linking the chrome debug back to your VSC workspace but it's an extra step imo).
- Starting working on background functionality. I'll be setting up a few conditionals that will change the background image depending on the cloudiness and temperature. Set up a default background image.
- Relative imports outside of src/ are not supported (in React) so moved my images to src folder.
- url paths in CSS files are relative to the position of the CSS file itself.
- Conditional styles in React - Reading to figure out how to set this up.

**Thoughts** 
- I'm acknowledging a definite fear to return to my project. In reality I know there is nothing to be scared of other than "failure". I'm reminding myself that the worst that can happen is that I try a few things, they don't work and I'm back at square one. No code gets lost, the app doesn't break and nobody gets hurt. Well maybe my ego a little.
- cmd mission control - Mac shortcut to clear desktop. Useful to know Mac shortcuts to make life quicker and easier. Especially with all these windows open on my 11" screen.
- CSS centering and background images - the main 2 areas I struggled to nail when learning CSS so this will be good practice.
- path structure - how to link the images. I struggle to work out the path if they are not in the same folder and don't appear in the IntelliSense in VSC. I remember this taking me ages to figure on my last Bootstrap project. 
- I'm getting stumped by a CSS basic which is laughable but understandable because I've only ever really copied tuts. Note to others: get yourself out of tutorial hell ASAP. It is painful but it is the best way to learn and will come back to haunt you without a doubt if you decide to stay comfortable. Please learn from my "mistake".
- Figured it was a no-repeat at the end of my line that was stopping it from working. I copied from a previous project but that only works with background not background-image.
- If your brain hurts and you are feeling grrr it's a sign you are learning and taking on the right task. Accept it as part of the journey, don't give up as soon as you feel that. Discomfort is the compass.

### Day 45: 17/5/20 ⁣
⁣
**Today's Progress**⁣
- Conditional styling. Got one condition to work (sunny background). The other two don't quite work yet (they change from the default but don't change the background to their respective conditions/images, just to a blank screen). Maybe switching to an if else rather than a ternary will do it. "It's not generally a good idea to use nested conditional operators, but it can be done."⁣
⁣
**Thoughts** ⁣
- Having multiple ways of doing things should be liberating but I'm actually feeling "analysis paralysis" and not committing to any way atm. Overwhelm is creeping in again. I'm getting really frustrated.⁣
- You have got to give SOMETHING a try otherwise you'll stay stuck and pissed off. You may even be pleasantly surprised.⁣
- I have jumped for tutorial hell into mental hell. This is where being self-taught really has its drawbacks as you don't have a teacher immediately on hand to settle you down and support you.⁣
- I am deliberately leaving all styling until the end. Get the functionality done first, then make it look good.⁣
- Practising debugging and troubleshooting is going to be worthwhile. I can see some elements are being changed but don't quite know where the block is. Knowing where to check (the console, react chrome extension, VSCode debugger) and what to look for will be a good skill going forward.

### Day 46: 18/5/20 

**Today's Progress**
- Weather API project.
- Full functionality on the backgrounds. I was missing a . before 2 of the CSS classes.
- Rounded temp figures using round.
- Planned extra spec (display name of country instead of the code) but unsure how to actually execute.
- Added description from JSON data (trying to capitalise first letter).
- npm run build and hosted app on GitHub pages (React apps use a slightly different process). 
- https://samchillcott.github.io/sam_react_weather_app/
- Reading about development v production build. The very basic difference is that Production Build has ugly, minified(compressed) version of your javascript code, so this makes rendering of file on end user's browser very quick and performance enhancing.
- Reading on how to create a good commit message -s hould be clear and meaningful. In cases of more extensive changes, you would need to add some extra details. If you work for a company or contribute to open source, you have to adapt to their convention.

**Thoughts** 
- As annoying as it is, it is quite relieving to discover the thing that was blocking you was something simple (like a missing . ). I wish VSCode had a meter displaying how close you are to the solution eg. "You are so cold" or "you are soooo close with this and it's something obvious".
- Getting into the swing of pushing to GH each time I make an alteration.
- My lack of experience in building in JS means I don't really have an idea of how I'd even start some of the extra spec (which means I don't always know what to google).
- Not too familiar with nam run build but managed to get it hosted. It gets me on edge not knowing what exactly I'm doing when I'm making changes but if the code works, I'm going to have to get used to that uncertainty while I don't understand it. I also seem to have moved/deleted some files as a result of the GHP hosting/build and the local server no longer works (which is probably normal). Hopefully I am still able to make changes going forward and that just updates the build accordingly. If not, I'll figure out how to rollback my git changes which will also be good practice.

**Questions**
- Does the build create a new copy/version of all the files (leaving the original non-build in tact) or just overwrite/transform the existing files into the build version?
- Can I run nam run start (development server) once I have made a build?

### Day 47: 19/5/20 

**Today's Progress**
- Updated Web Design doc to include inspiration section. This will give me some ideas on how to style both my Weather App and my portfolio (which I will be doing in the coming weeks).
- Sketched app design layout on pen and paper to get an idea of how I'd like it to look. Started with mobile first.
- Cloned a pre build version of the app back to my machine to make further changes. 
- Mentor session on cloning, branching and pull requests in GH. I now have 2 branches of my app: development build and production build.
- Git Graph VSCode extension - I can visualise my branches and commits now.
- Identified a few extra features I can add. 

**Thoughts** 
- When it comes to styling, I like to take the sampling approach (I like the font from this site, the layout from this one and the colours from this one). Having a rough idea or design before you come to code the CSS definitely helps. Personally, I have found in the past without having some sort of reference I can get lost in terms of direction/outcome when it comes to styling.
- I will maybe check out sigma or webflow at some point but it's not needed at this stage as I'm only styling a single page app with minimal components.
- Not having a specific plan of attack means I "worked" today (pre mentor sesh) but didn't really have anything to show for it. Always have a roadmap (not just for the coming weeks/months but also each day).
- I'm happy I now know where git commits go (the git folder in the project which was hidden) and feel a bit more comfortable with the whole process of version control.

### Day OFF: 20/5/20 

**Today's Progress**
- N/A

**Thoughts** 
- It is such a nice feeling when you wake up on a day off knowing you aren't going to stress the brain. There is still that little bit of pressure because you know you'll be back it it in a day or two.
- This is only my third day off in 47 days so I don't feel so bad about it. I have been hammering because I wanted to finish it as soon as possible. My plans have slightly changed though so I've taken a bit of pressure of myself to do that so could potentially take more breaks going forward.
- Lately I'm really seeing the difference between learning something and knowing how to do/use that knowledge. I really want to start applying what I'm learning going forward.
- Ironically, taking time off/out is when my brain is most active and comes up with great ideas/solutions so it's tough to stay switched off.
- Almost half way and giving myself some credit for getting this far and what I am able to create that I couldn't do 47 days ago.

### Day 48: 21/5/20 ⁣
⁣
**Today's Progress**⁣
- New feature attempt: expand the country code to the full country name.⁣
- GitHub Gist - an easy method to share snippets or excerpts of data with others hosted by GitHub as a repository.⁣
- Reading up on common JS errors to get used to solving some basic mistakes.⁣
- x is not defined - undefined means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. Think of it as a key-value pair without a value. You’ve created the variable but not given it a value.⁣
- Debugging session with my mentor - how to understand the stack trace and test assumptions.⁣
⁣
**Thoughts** ⁣
- I'm getting quite good at planning the logic and knowing what needs to be done but executing that in code is where my bottleneck is atm. This is highlighting a weak area of not knowing how to USE JavaScript. I can read it pretty well but in terms of using it as a tool to provide a solution, I have some work to do. Sure it will get better with practice.⁣
- I am actually quite embarrassed how much I don't know how to program basic JS myself at this stage. My delayed escape from tutorial hell has been a major reason for this.⁣
- Also inexperience in debugging slows down the learning process. If you know what you are doing wrong you can figure out what to change.

### Day 49: 22/5/20 ⁣
⁣
**Today's Progress**⁣
- General debugging tips (first 6 ref Andy Sterkowitz):⁣
- Switch your mode of thinking. Slow down and be inquisitive.⁣
- Check your logic (the instructions you gave your computer).⁣
- Read the error messages - they are your best friend.⁣
- Assume human error and check for simple errors.⁣
- Make small changes and fix them often (prevents creating more bugs).⁣
- Take mental breaks - allow the brain to get creative/problem-solve (diffused learning/thinking)⁣
- Read the stack trace. ⁣
- Error handling - if the program keeps crashing at a particular spot, try surrounding that code with try & catch blocks and investigating the error object that gets returned.⁣
- Commenting out - in the block where you think the problem may be, comment it all out (bar the first line) then add lines back in one at a time and test.⁣
--⁣
- null v undefined v not defined - Javascript has three ways to describe values which don’t exist or should not exist in general.⁣
⁣
**Thoughts** ⁣
- Debugging hasn't really been needed up until now. Now I am writing the code myself, the ability to debug is super important.⁣
- I will be learning how to read the stack trace the next day or so.⁣
- Am intrigued by diffused learning so will read up on it.

### Day 50: 23/5/20 

**Today's Progress**
- Debugging ctd.
- Call stack v stack trace - while you're debugging you will look at the current call stack but when you look at logs, you'll get a stack trace. Call stack and stack trace error are the 2 most important things to look at when looking at a problem.
- Stack trace anatomy - It stacks up from the bottom to the top. Look at the top AND the bottom. Look at the stack traces from the top, work your way down. The bottom is the root cause.
- Naming functions and error messages are important for debugging with stack traces.
- Explicitly throw errors with meaningful messages to help out your future self when you’re debugging your code.
- Memory Heap — this is where the memory allocation happens. Objects are allocated in a heap which is just a name to denote a large (mostly unstructured) region of memory.
- Call Stack — this is where your stack frames are as your code executes. Each entry in the Call Stack is called a Stack Frame.
- Updated favicon and title for weather app.
- Signed up for and had a look at HackerRank to practice some basic JS challenges in the future.

**Thoughts** 
- I'm learning this now so when I add the new features to my app, I will have a better toolkit to get the features functional and the time spent learning to debug will by far outweigh the time potentially looking at my errors and not knowing what to do next.
- I get the impression that when employed as a dev, much of the time you aren't actually building new code, you are trying to solve problems with existing code. I actually like the thought of this (or maybe I am saying that because I'm not yet competent writing my own code?).
- Half way through the challenge. Pleased with progress and my routine. Aiming to be way more competent and confident in writing JS by the end of the challenge. I have a fair bit of knowledge, now it is time to apply it.

### Day 51: 24/5/20 

**Today's Progress**
- Weather App update.
- Bespoke error alerts for failed API request and successful API request but incorrect city entered.

**Thoughts** 
- Really not in the right headspace for coding but didn't want to have a day off so did something easy and called it a day. Will come back again tomorrow.
- I get in these moods when I'm either stressed or tired. I didn't sleep well last night so was aware I could have "one of those days" where my patience and tolerance is low. Catching and acknowledging it really helps me deal with it. If I HAD to get on and work, obviously I'd battle through it but I don't have to so I won't and give myself a pass today.

### Day 52: 25/5/20 

**Today's Progress**
- CSS styling for weather app. Added:
- Google font.
- Wrapper box with opacity.
- Icon from the JSON.
- Capitalised the description.
- Fixed position of wrapper so when data appears the top of the wrapper doesn't move up.
- Changed app initial background to a gradient.

**Thoughts** 
- Stick to one task at a time until completion. Found myself getting pulled to the next task a few times."Ooh wouldn't it be cool if x ? How do I do that? Let me google it..".
- Looking at other well-designed apps makes me realise my UI skills aren't as good as I'd like but to be fair, I've spent more time learning development and functionality over design.
- I'm getting lost without a design to aim for.
- Got myself in a right mess changing a few things then ctrl z'ing. Want to be able to rollback with confidence in future. Figured "discard all changes" (before staging in the sidebar) does the trick. As long as you save the commit previously.
- Still not quite nailed CSS positioning but getting better.
- I do enjoy making sites/apps look a bit sleeker.
- Enjoyed today's session as I could do a lot of the tasks without having to google/learn. My skill level was up to the challenge so I was able to get into flow state more. Something which I haven't been able to do for ages because my skill level has been way below the level of the challenge. Looking forward to more days like this in the future.

#100DayOfCode [53/100]⁣
⁣
### Day 53: 26/5/20 ⁣
⁣
**Today's Progress**⁣
- Weather App Autocomplete - I would like to have an extra feature where suggestions appear as the user types in the input field.⁣
- Added 4th background option to cover when clouds > 50% && temp > 20. My mentor did say he left out some of the spec to see how I'd handle it. I think I found what he was hinting at.⁣
- Code and project review with mentor @voyzan. Mutually decided to wrap this app up and move to another project.⁣
- Updated error handling. Be prepared for more than one error case (it is not binary - it works v it doesn't work) and have bespoke / specific error handlers (especially for ones we expect).⁣
- Updated ternary operator to if else logic (to alter the background image).⁣
⁣
**Thoughts** ⁣
- There are quite a few ways to do autocomplete. All of which look long-winded. It would be good practice to attempt one but wondering if it would be worthwhile at this point.⁣
- There are quite a few other features I'd love to add (which weren't all part of the original spec) but I'm thinking the app works atm and maybe it is time to start on project 2 and look toward getting a portfolio site created with at least 2 projects. That will serve me more than one project and I can always come back and add the features at a later date. Build upon existing projects.⁣
- I'm getting into the habit of asking for guidance/direction (not necessarily help) once you've looked at options.⁣
- Knowing when to call it a day and move on - Was a good call to at least consider moving on. Feel glad now we are moving on.

### Day 54: 27/5/20 

**Today's Progress**
- Redraw on keypress - I have seen that react refreshes state (twice!) each time a key is pressed (and on loading of the app)so attempted to prevent this behaviour. Mentor set this as my challenge for the day but unable to find/implement a solution myself but after chatting I think it is using shouldComponentUpdate/React.memo. I know where it is happening though thanks to debugging skills. 
- New branch on Git - I made a new branch for this bug fix to get a bit of practice using branches and merging. Eventually I will merge (via PR) the dev branch back with the production branch.
- Check out - The git checkout command lets you navigate between the branches created by git branch. Checking out a branch updates the files in the working directory to match the version stored in that branch, and it tells Git to record all new commits on that branch.
- GitHub contributions - Reading on how to get more green. Contributions (issues, pull requests and commits) are only counted if they meet certain criteria and I don't think my work recently (other than creating new repos) has counted.

**Thoughts** 
- Git Graph - Spent 15 mins trying to view Git Graph then realised there was a button at the bottom of VSCode. It's all very well installing all these extensions but if you don't know how to use them..
- I want to be more comfortable with Git/branches. I have an irrational fear of deleting (all my) work so knowing what is going on will ease that discomfort. 
- Git skills can be a differentiator when it comes to job applications, needed for open source and for daily pro dev life.
- Don't really feel like I've accomplished much today (started 3 different things and didn't really "complete" 2 of them and was task switching a lot) but I know some good learnings and progress have been had that will come in handy in the future.

### Day 55: 28/5/20 

**Today's Progress**
- Git branches - Getting head (good pun) around what is going on when a new branch is created. My new branch (created for the redraw fix) hadn't been pushed so it didn't show in GH. 
- Detached HEAD state - You can look around, make experimental changes and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this state without impacting any branches by performing another checkout.
- Redraw fix - attempted to use React.memo to prevent redraw on each keystroke. Doesn't seem to work.
- React.memo is a higher order component. It’s similar to React.PureComponent but for function components instead of classes.

**Thoughts** 
- Unsure why my branches have changed colours after a commit. This really puts me on edge thinking I may be messing up the structure.
- Got quite confused with all the different branches and terms: master, origin/HEAD, origin/master, branchname,
branchname/origin. Realised/remembered origin branches are the ones on GH/remote so makes a bit more sense now.
- Doesn't look like new branch (redraw_fix) is branching off the dev branch on GG. Or maybe it is, I can't tell.
- Another day where I feel I haven't made much progress. Or at least have nothing to show for it. Going round in circles a bit.
- Wondering if my lack of understanding of lifecycles is hindering me. I know hooks do this for me nowadays but I don't really know what useEffect is doing. 
- I like how there is good documentation for React. My challenge is a lot of it is still over my head at this stage.
- Can feel frustration building up so calling it a day today.

### Day 56: 29/5/20 

**Today's Progress**
- Trying to prevent state being changed each keystroke in the form. Possibly due to my logic, not necessarily react. The form onChange is triggering the function (each key stroke) that changes the state.
- Readonly means the input field won't be editable.
- Solved the keystroke issue but then app no longer functions after submit. It is not grabbing the value from the input field. Will try again tomorrow.

**Thoughts** 
- Worry Dump - Did a coaching exercise to list all the things I am worried/stressed about in terms of my coding journey (Exercise in Resources section of my website). Was good to get it onto paper and came up with an action plan. Feel better for it.
- Quick chat with mentor. General advice: Try different solutions to get it working. I think I have been giving up too easily by quitting after solution 1 doesn't work. And also a fear of attempting the "wrong" solution (even if I get the code working it doesn't do what I hoped).
- I am getting caught out by modelling my code on someone else's because I don't know the full ins and outs of the code (specifically the event handler functions). Yes, the code works but I don't 100% know how which means when it comes to trouble shooting, there are grey areas in my understanding of the code.
- Spent another 3 hours on it to no avail but am getting used to finding and trying different solutions, following the logic and not caving in mentally. I can feel I'm close to solving this.

### Day 57: 30/5/20 ⁣
⁣
**Today's Progress**⁣
- CA loops and higher-order functions practice. Want to complete the CA JS to 100% at some point.⁣
- When we pass in a higher-order function, it is by reference, not by return value. We want to invoke it only once it is inside the other function’s body.⁣
- Think of callbacks as variables for functions – they can take on many different function values – whereas calling a function directly is like using a constant.⁣
- Reading about the concept of Intuition in programming. The more you code, the better you will get at knowing what to do, basically. Some also call it experience.⁣
- React component lifecycle reading. Although these are handled differently nowadays it is good to know what is involved.⁣
- Mounting - to mount is to make a group of files in a file system structure accessible to a user or user group.⁣
- shouldComponentUpdate attempt. Get the logic, can't get it working in my app.⁣
⁣
**Thoughts** ⁣
- Steady day of odds and sods. Wanted to do some hours but not start anything new/big because I plan to have tomorrow off.⁣
- Although CA is pretty basic, I'm actually quite rusty on the logic and syntax. This has been good practice to get thinking for myself and not rely on tuts. I'd like to do more of these little brainteasers.⁣
- "Intuition comes from grinding away at fundamentals." This quote was buried in the CA forum. Intuition is what my mentor talks about and that it will come with time.⁣
- Pass by reference and pass by value make a lot more sense now I am revisiting it. I didn't quite get it at the time.⁣
- Sometimes I take terminology for granted. Every now and again I ask "what does that even mean?" and go google. ⁣
- After a few convos, I have decided to leave the re-render issue. I gave it a go but not worth getting hung up on (like I did with promises) a while back. Time to move on.

### Day OFF: 31/5/20 ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
**Today's Progress**⁣⁣
- N/A⁣⁣
⁣⁣
**Thoughts** ⁣⁣
- My logged hours has definitely dropped over the last month but my applied learning has improved big time. I've gone from relying on tuts and passive learning where it is easier to log the hours to active applied learning where it is more taxing and frustrating. Initially, I was disappointed with the drop in hours but it makes sense and if I was to look back at where I was the start of the month, my knowledge and intuition have grown quite a bit. It's cool to track the hours but its what you do in that time and after that really matters. ⁣⁣
- Looking forward to my next challenge (set by my mentor) which just arrived in the inbox. Will check it out tomorrow. No code today.

### Day 58: 1/6/20 ⁣
⁣
**Today's Progress**⁣
- Project planning reading - Technology selection, prioritising feature list (or using versions), mock-ups & storyboarding, high-level architecture, pseudocode, timelines.⁣
- High-level architecture - breaking it into categories like "objects", "logic", "user interaction", "user data", and "scenes" - and then think about how you might implement them, like as object-oriented object types, functions, or variables.⁣
- Project 2 challenge: Coaching Question Generator. Planned out my high-level architecture.⁣
- Created React app and linked to GH. To avoid errors, do not initialize the new repository with README, license, or gitignore files. You can add these files after your project has been pushed to GitHub.⁣
- Matched email address in Git/GitHub so commits now register as contributions.⁣
⁣
**Thoughts** ⁣
- The project has been chosen because it is fairly simple and will give me good practice to code from scratch and build new neural pathways. It is a spin on a classic exercise and is something I (and some coaches I know) would potentially use.⁣
- I like the challenge of starting from scratch, I really have to think how the data is going to be passed around. Creating a basic react app from scratch will also get me more familiar with the recurring themes and how to plan state and props between components.⁣
- It is tough to resist just googling a lot of this (which there is nothing wrong with) but I want to try on my own for as long as I can.⁣
- Chuffed my commits now show as green on GH. I will figure out how to change previous commits under the unmatched email.

### Day 59: 2/6/20 

**Today's Progress**
- Drafting logic for Coaching Question Generator.
- Attempted fetch() logic.
- Set up state and props accordingly.
- onClick event handler - invoke randomQuestion when Generate button clicked.
- Decided to strip it back (not using fetch or JSON) and start with the most simple option to get something showing in the component using the onClick handler.
- Added randomness functionality using math.floor.

**Thoughts** 
- Got as far as I can from memory/current knowledge so had to look up a few things. Am still making a conscious effort to not copy directly from a tut (I could easily google "question generator React"). I am allowing myself to use sections from multiple resources as a reference. That will still give me practice in googling and refactoring the answer to execute in my code base.
- Some of this I haven't done before so I have to google it to know how to do it in the first place. 
- Feeling slight overwhelm again due to so many "open loops". Tackle one at a time.
- There is a part of me that wants it to compile correctly each time I add code but that hinders my progress in terms of adding pseudocode. Maybe I am best adding all the code THEN trying to debug.
- There is also an internal battle to "get it done (it doesn't matter how)" and "work it out for yourself (stop googling)". Basically Do it v Learn it. Bit I'm sure by doing, I'll also learn.
- I have forgotten a lot of my non React DOM manipulation so converting my googled JS questions back into React is not straight forward.
- I am starting to see the multiple ways of doing this app and suffering from the paradox of choice again. I have half committed to about 3 ways and not got any working yet. More detailed and considered planning would have prevented this.
- Debugging skills definitely helped me figure out how to get my data showing.
- One of my best days in terms of chipping away and enjoying it.

### Day 60: 3/6/20 

**Today's Progress**
- Coaching Question Generator App.
- No repeat functionality. Got it not repeating but needs a refresh to reset.
- Attempted a different approach using 2 arrays but ended up with React infinite loop/rendering warning. Will endeavour to solve.
- .splice() - adds/removes items to/from an array, and returns the removed item(s). This method changes the original array.

**Thoughts** 
- I'm getting better at refactoring Stack Overflow/googled answers and suggestions into my code. I know what needs to be substituted or altered because I understand code better lately.
- Deciphering each line in a text doc helped me figure how the "copied" code works internally. Once I know this, I can work out what I need to do to it to get it working in my codebase. Colour coding the variables and functions helps see what get used where.
- I have noticed I get a natural reaction of anxiety/fear if I see a block of code that is bigger than about 10 lines. I shall catch myself from now on and just remind myself that I can break it down and just because it is a lot of code, doesn't mean it is super difficult. It usually isn't, just verbose.
- Today has been good practice working with arrays and array methods. I have seen a lot of tests/challenges online using various methods but never really done any myself. I know there will be a lot in the future.
- Spent 3 hours on 17 lines of code (which I haven't even got working in my app yet) but super worthwhile time spent.
- Started practicing using debugging tool rather than console logs. Step is awesome as it shows what variables are as you go. Using Watch really helps too. I can now see at what point things start to go wonky (and quicker than dotted console logs).

### Day 61: 4/6/20 

**Today's Progress**
- Quick refresher on function return values and when to use return keyword explicitly.
- Rewrote logic for the random, non-repeating question selector function from scratch. Looks right on paper so just need to iron out the kinks and track variables to check it is doing what I assume it is doing.
- <React.StrictMode> is what is causing the double render. StrictMode renders components twice (on dev but not production) in order to detect any problems with your code and warn you about them (which can be quite useful).

**Thoughts** 
- I do enjoy when I wake up my brain has kinda solved something in my sleep and the ideas start flowing before I even get out of bed.
- I am really having to think line by line on how I want this onClick function to work. Rubber duck technique and pen and paper helping here.
- I've got sketches of commented out code blocks all over my file which is getting a bit cluttered. Wonder if there is a better way of doing this. I want to keep my sketches in case I want to come back to them.
- Using copied code isn't helping me atm (but has been useful for inspiration at least). Reverted to working it out from scratch from the bottom up on my own. "What do I want to have happen?" (classic coaching question) and some reverse engineering.
- Kept having trouble with server - sometimes just loading, sometimes going straight to debugger. Possibly something I'm doing but slowing down my ability to check my code.
- I seem to be getting the double redraw on the main App again. Not worried about it for now though. Although if it is executing twice it is resetting my arrays!
- I know I am so close. I am buzzing.
- I am laughing at how challenging this is. I love it. I'm enjoying it. 
- I could do another few hours on this but decided to pause for now and bring the positive energy over to tomorrow's session for momentum.

### Day 62: 5/6/20 

**Today's Progress**
- No-repeat functionality for Question App.
- Attempted to fix the logic.
- Attempted a different logic on a new branch. It is random but still repeats. Most probably due to control flow/resetting somewhere.

**Thoughts** 
- I know this is fairly basic stuff (moving stuff between arrays, writing nested functions) but because I spent a long time in tutorial hell, these basic concepts were never ingrained. Happy I am learning them now.
- I think scope and return (variables not being available outside a block) is where yesterday's code got stuck.
- Referring to my googled answer to see what I am missing. There were a few lines I didn't see the purpose of but now I understand.
- I get what each suggestion is doing but I sense there is (a potentially simple) missing link on how I integrate it to mine.
- Also getting caught out by pass by reference/pass by value. I want the result of a function, not the function itself.
- The fact I am learning function creation/logic within the context of React adds an extra layer of quirks to consider compared to if I was using vanilla JS.
- I am wondering if some of the logic needs to be moved to the Question component. And do I need to store something in state so it doesn't reset?
- I wonder if closure is at play here - related to my resetting each onClick. I've not learnt closure at all yet.
- Still can't get Git branch to work properly = scared to commit changes in case it writes over original branch. 
- Another 3 hours on this today but I am determined to work this out on my own because I know it will really help me consolidate JS functions, logic, control flow and React state knowledge.

### Day 63: 6/6/20 

**Today's Progress**
- Branch reading and practice. I want to be confident I can make branches/sketches without overwriting anything. Branches are just pointers to commits. When you create a branch, all Git needs to do is create a new pointer, it doesn’t change the repository in any other way.
- Pull request v merge - both do git merge but PR (GH feature) has options for notes and discussions via GH. PRs aren't really needed if there is only a single person on the repository.
- Attempt to integrate full code from the other day. It complies but getting infinite loop error (calling your state setter immediately inside the function component body, which forces React to re-invoke your function again).
- Solved the infinite loop and got it working but still repeating. Sure it is down to scope (which I have now sorted) and the fact it is running the App code twice.
- ctrl c returns to terminal prompt (but will also disconnect the server).
- "Highlight updates when components render." In React dev tools settings is helpful.

**Thoughts** 
- Getting stuck and trouble shooting over the last week has really strengthened my intuition muscle. I can read and understand errors, I can follow what my variables should be at each stage, I know where to look in my code for what to change, I know how to write functions from scratch. I feel way more competent (regardless of the fact I still haven't solved the non-repeat. Yet).
- I'd like to get used to doing PR because I won't be the only one using the repo in the future.
- Once I come out of debugger the server is struggling to work again. Used bespoke tactically placed console logs.
- I'm pretty sure my logic works and it is React double render/refresh that is preventing the non-repeat functionality. This is something I picked up on in the last project (where luckily it didn't cause an issue). I also think it is normal React behaviour and can be worked around possibly using hooks.

### Day OFF: 7/6/20 

**Today's Progress**
- N/A

**Thoughts** 
- There has been a shift. Normally I have days off because I want to give it a rest/had enough or I'm close to a little burnout. This time I scheduled the day off but really wanted to get back to it so it was hard to stay away. The increased ability has meant I wake up now thinking "Hmm I wonder if this approach will work? I can't wait to try" instead of "I have no idea how I am going to do this and I can sense I am going to get pi$$ed off".
- Spent a quality day out in the countryside and chilling with some UFC.

### Day 64: 8/6/20 ⁣
⁣
**Today's Progress**⁣
- Attempt to circumnavigate React redrawing (and resetting) component each time onClick is fired. ⁣
- Moved logic and state to Question component, same issue. Obvs.⁣
- var x = y; x will copy the value of y if y is a string, number, boolean, null or undefined. However, if it's an object, array or a function x will store its reference. This can cause issues when setting state.⁣
- Attempted to give my copy arrays (data and chosenItems) state so they hold between re-renders. Success! Questions no longer repeat.⁣
- Converted question from [object Object] and saved as a variable so copy to clipboard now works correctly.⁣
- Used that same variable to use in the Tweet Share link so that is working too now.⁣
⁣
**Thoughts** ⁣
- I have a feeling it is my React component architecture that may be tripping me up. Checked some old projects to see where the logic and states usually get set. It's not all always done in App.js.⁣
- Although I am determined to figure this out myself (and I am sure I will eventually) I think I have put enough time into the React issue. I know it can be solved in 5 mins with someone who knows React so it may be time to ask for help = more efficient use of time so I can move on.⁣
- Ha, the extra 30 mins I put in before giving up found a solution! I think I have solved it.⁣
- There is still the rare case of the last question chosen in the array could end up also being the first question selected after reset. I could probably make a conditional to prevent this. The larger the database, the lower the probability this could happen though.⁣
- I have spent way over 10 hours on this small part of functionality but going through the process of finding, evaluating and attempting multiple solutions has given me so much experience and strengthened my intuition immensely. I'm glad I didn't give up and ask for the solution. I would have missed all that good stuff. Even if it was painful!

**Today's Progress**
- N/A.

**Thoughts** 
- Taking time to be grateful not just for my progress but my life and situation. Will spend some time educating myself on current world events. 
- Also did some reading on diffused thinking. Basically taking time out for the brain to connect some dots. I will make more of an effort to do this each day by either going for a walk or a run after coding sessions to let the brain work some magic.

### Day 65: 10/6/20 ⁣
⁣
**Today's Progress**⁣
- Added a few more Qs to the pool.⁣
- Merge back into master. GitGraph looks how I imagined/hoped.⁣
- Fast Forward in Git - fast forwards the master branch's pointer to match the merged commits if the master hasn't changed since branch off.⁣
- Squash commits -  Instead of seeing all of a contributor's individual commits from a topic branch, the commits are combined into one commit and merged into the default branch.⁣
- Created new branch for next feature: hide clipboard and tweet on initialise (only show after the user has clicked Generate once). Getting into the routine of creating new branches and not messing with the master.⁣
- Completed hide share bar feature and used Pull Request on GH to merge back in. Deleted branch.⁣
- Connected GH to Netlify and had a quick look at how to host my React app.⁣
⁣
**Thoughts** ⁣
- Starting to get more confident with branching, merging and Pull Requests. Also head, base, origin, master are making more sense now⁣
- Still a bit unsure on deployment, builds and CI etc. but will cover that in the coming weeks.

### Day 66: 11/6/20 

**Today's Progress**
- Basic styling for Coaching Question App.
- Sorted twitter button appearance.
- Added title.
- Twitter button not hiding/showing as planned now I moved the share bar out of the Question component. Client is blocking the GET request for some reason. Possibly to do with Ad Blocker extension. Will leave it for now.

**Thoughts** 
- I want to get some basic styling done and get it hosted ASAP. That way it is ready to show and I can practice continuous deployment going forward. 
- My styling is pretty minimal and not terrible. But also not super cool. Not fussed about it for now, as long as it doesn't look woeful.
- I'd like to do more work with microinteractions and animations at some point but I want to get good at macro functionality before I worry about the icing and cherries.
- I keep adding to my "cool features and tweaks/styling to add" list. I'll leave them for now but will be cool things to work on at a later date.
- I still haven't mastered preventing contents from leaving a div. It's only happening on edge cases in my app but it would be good CSS basic knowledge.
- I will look into build/branch/hosting tomorrow. Really want to get head around how to deploy and update when using React apps (which require a build before they can be hosted as far as I'm aware).

### Day 67: 12/6/20 ⁣
⁣
**Today's Progress**⁣
- Reading on production builds and deployment with React.⁣
- Uglify - to minify, parse and compress JS.⁣
- Learning about Source maps, static files and Hash.⁣
- Netlify - Deployed test branch to be hosted. Works well but noticed some functionality had been broken yesterday (ctc works fine but tweet share is not working as it was).⁣
- Updated favicon.⁣
- Attempt to fix the twitter bug. Has to do with it being an iframe.⁣
- Chat with mentor @voyzan reviewing code and planning the next area of work.⁣
⁣
**Thoughts** ⁣
- School day learning what all these terms actually mean. I hear them all the time so its good to get a proper understanding.⁣
- Happy to get a project hosted. Albeit there are still a few tweaks I'd like to do to get it to a presentable level.⁣
- My perfectionist tendencies are making me feel uncomfortable with all these little open loops (even though they are insignificant really).⁣
- Love how Netlify does auto/continuous deployment and does the building for you. You just tell it which branch to deploy from in your repo. ⁣
- For some reason, I had it in my head that once you did npm run build you couldn't go back (build and development were mutually exclusive). Now I see that they aren't. You can build, add a feature then build again.⁣
- Looking forward to wrapping up this project and moving onto the next phase of my journey.

### Day 68: 13/6/20 

**Today's Progress**
- Created code optimisation document and bookmarked some content.
- edabit JS challenges on Very Easy level then on to Easy.
- Recursion is a technique for iterating over an operation by having a function call itself repeatedly until it arrives at a result.

**Thoughts** 
- The next few days/weeks will be spent beefing up my JS logic muscles. I want to start at the ridiculously basic and work up to find my level. Then increase my level from there. I want to be able to speak (unassisted) JS competently and I want to do it as efficiently as I can.
- Gym weights analogy. Reps and finding weight that will tear the muscle.
- Breezed through first 10 or so. Now some are still simple but do require some thinking.
- Good practice optimising and refactoring if else into ternaries. If you are returning a ternary it needs to be in ().
- It's not necessary to return true if the condition that is being returned already evaluates to true
- Took the afternoon to spend some time with the family but wasn't really present as I found myself resenting being there because I wanted to code. I'd also like to build the muscle of work life balance and be able to switch off.
- edabit is annoying because you have to constantly flick between the question and the code tabs. I want to be able to read the question next to my code. Feature request sent.
- Recursive functions seem a bit advanced for "Easy" section. Comments section tend to agree.

⁣
### Day 69: 14/6/20 ⁣
⁣
**Today's Progress**⁣
- Clean code reading.⁣
- KISS - Ask: Can this be written in a simpler way?⁣
- DRY - don't repeat yourself. Use functions instead of repeating blocks.⁣
- YAGNI: You Aren't Gonna Need It. A developer should not add functionality unless deemed necessary.⁣
- Favour readability - There's no point in having concise code if people don't understand it.⁣
- Practice consistency - If you decide to do something a certain way, stick to it throughout the entire project.⁣
- Verb Noun naming convention - describe the action it will perform with a verb, such as get, set, transform, or render. Then include a description of the value that the method will return or update⁣
- Classes and functions should be small and obey the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).⁣
- Positive Boolean Variables - Avoid double negatives in your code by writing boolean variables positively.⁣
- Pure functions - a method that does not depend on an external mutable state.⁣
- Catch and handle exceptions, even if you don’t think you need to.⁣
- Logs, logs, logs - You should be logging every major “step” your program takes, any important calculations it makes, any errors, exceptions, or out of the ordinary results.⁣
- Comments are often lies waiting to happen - While comments are important, code should speak for itself whenever possible.⁣
⁣
**Thoughts** ⁣
- Not in the right mind state for challenges so opted for passive learning today. Look forward to implementing learnings when I return to the challenges.

### Day 70: 15/6/20 ⁣
⁣
**Today's Progress**⁣
- edabit "Easy" challenges.⁣
- Practice with Math.min, shift, join, toString, slice, reduce, FOR loops, addition assignment operator (+=), eval, remainder operator (%).⁣
⁣
**Thoughts** ⁣
- Cool to use and come across new built-in and array methods. My last 2 projects have only really had up to about 5 functions each so my exposure to all that JS has to offer has been minimal. ⁣
- I like how edabit allows multiple ways to solve. Codeacademy was strict especially on syntax. edabit uses tests so as long as your code returns the expected results, you pass. You can also view alternative solutions to see how others created their functions. It is fascinating to see their approach but also how you can potentially improve your own code.⁣
- I like how you can debug and iterate by checking your test results = feedback.⁣
- I prefer to google my potential solutions rather than use the resources tab which hints at which methods to use. I prefer to try and figure that out for myself.⁣
- Funny how the 3 methods I used can be done in one but I learned 4 in total so who's the mug?⁣
- My array method knowledge is pitiful. Glad I am doing these challenges. The "Easy" section is hard for me atm because I don't know what (common) methods are available and therefore struggle to know where to even start.⁣
- It is harder to debug your solution because you can't console.log to see the point in your code where you are going wrong.⁣
- Wondering whether it is best to time limit myself to solve each challenge or keep going until I get it. Both probably beneficial tbh because even if I'm not solving it (yet), I'm working the muscle to try. ⁣
- Decided to check solutions after 90 mins. Some of which I would never have got.⁣
- Somewhat demoralising success rate but now I know my level and what I would like to improve.

### Day 71: 16/6/20 ⁣
⁣
**Today's Progress**⁣
- edabit Very Easy: Success Rate approx 90% over 3 hours.⁣
- Learnings: Bitwise Operators, concat, reverse, split, indexOf, charAt, pop, switch (and case) statement, arguments.length.⁣
- Booleans can also be written as integers, where 1 = True and 0 = False.⁣
- .length -1 gives you the last item in the array (because the index starts at 0).⁣
⁣
**Thoughts** ⁣
- I'm checking the Resources section earlier now so I can at least get some momentum and practice integrating methods into my code from documentation. I'll revert to avoiding Resources when I have a bit more ability at this level.⁣
- Setting a 15 min time limit to solve myself.⁣
- I am still learning even if I check the solutions.⁣
- Some of these I am almost completing, just getting stumped by the edge cases that they throw in. All good practice for the real world though.⁣
- So annoying I can't debug, I could solve most of these if I could check my variables throughout the code (when there is more than one line of code). Suppose I could return my output (at a certain stage) as an "answer" and build from there so at least I can check it.⁣
- These are starting to get a little easier for me now I know the common methods available to me. Which also means I don't need to check the resources section as much now.⁣
- Getting really good at ternary operators.⁣
- Started off hit and miss on Easy now its mainly hits so time to move to Medium difficulty. ⁣
- These are testing my algebra skills as well as coding. It's all logic.⁣
- There is a distinction between solving on my own and solving after I read the Resources. Will track "solved", "solved with hint", "pass/fail" going forward.⁣
- Although I started on Easy, apparently I have been on Very Easy for the last 2 hours. wtf edabit?!

### Day 72: 17/6/20 ⁣
⁣
**Today's Progress**⁣
- Merge conflicts brief reading.⁣
- Attempt to update hosted weather app to latest version.⁣
- edabit on Easy: 30% Success rate in 1 hr.⁣
- Math.abs() returns the absolute value of a number.⁣
- Regular Expressions (RegExp) - A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern. The search pattern can be used for text search and text replace operations.⁣
⁣
**Thoughts** ⁣
- Got myself in a bit of a pickle with my weather app, build and branches. Leave for now, scared of messing something up.⁣
- Making sure I manually stay on edabit Easy level even though it keeps putting me back on V.Easy automatically.⁣
- I was about to get annoyed with my math being tested - "Whats this got to do with coding?", but now I realise this is great practice for business logic. Converting what you want to happen in the real world into code.⁣
- Some of these "Easy" ones are pretty hard (for me) even once you check the resources.⁣
- My loop skills could be improved. Both knowing when to use, which version and how to execute.⁣
- I can feel my brain muscles tearing. The neural pathways are being formed. It's annoying, it's painful but it's working and its worth it.⁣
- Might look into recursion. Unsure what it is but it popping up a lot here and could be useful.⁣
- I've been hammering the physical fitness this week which gave me an initial upturn in mood but think tiredness is catching up with me now. Might try to dial down the daily running distance.

### Day 73: 17/6/20 ⁣
⁣
**Today's Progress**⁣
- edabit Easy: 100% success @ 20mins per Q.⁣
- Date object - new Date() creates a new date object with the current date and time.⁣
- Less Than or Equal To operator. Easy way to remember: think of a reverse fat arrow rather than a sad face.⁣
- Number.isInteger() method determines whether a value is an integer.⁣
- RegExp and quantifiers - If you don't give any parameter and use the match() method directly, you will get an Array with an empty string.⁣
- filter() practice.⁣
⁣
**Thoughts** ⁣
- If the Q is more math than JS then I'm skipping. Time can be spent better elsewhere. There is problem-solving and there is problem-solving with math. ⁣
- I am now logging rough completion time as well as whether I complete/use Resources/fail. Albeit the important metric for me is "Can I solve it without using the Resources?" Because this is good practice to search avenues and attempt different approaches.⁣
- I am getting good at googling and refactoring SO code, so even if I am not using Resources (which are super hints), I am still working out how to get the function to work.⁣
- Easy is becoming Easier, think I could be ready for Medium soon. Or may do some more Easy on the recursion and regex.⁣
- Pen and paper helping to formulate what I want the function to do. ⁣
- As always, breaking down the challenge into parts is helping.⁣
- Am skipping algebra, RegExp and recursion based Qs for now. Might come back at some point.⁣
- I am solving at a good % rate. I can now see how I can improve both in terms of time taken to complete and lines of code used. Really happy with progress so far.⁣
- RegExp seems like it would be used a lot IRL so will spend some time on them next day or so. I get what they do but struggling with the syntax to set them up. Loops practice again wouldn't go amiss.⁣
- I am spending a good few minutes reviewing other people's solutions so I am probably solving at a quicker solved per time rate than I am logging.⁣
- Really getting into flow state. My ability is up to the challenge. Enjoyable session today!

### Day 74: 19/6/20 ⁣
⁣
**Today's Progress**⁣
- Regular Expressions - a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern. Common uses include search, find and replace, password and hex code validation. Also leant basic flags and metacharacters.⁣
- Attempt the remaining 13 Easy RegEx on edabit: 2 solved without using Resources and 1 checked solution in 2.5hrs = success rate 66%.⁣
- match() needs to be used with a regex.⁣
- You need backslashes to escape the regular expression special characters.⁣
- The ^ means not and is a "caret", not "carrot".⁣
- Regex is case-sensitive, \d matches a digit, and \D matches anything but a digit.⁣
- Combining RegEx patterns.⁣
⁣
**Thoughts** ⁣
- Got the basics of RegEx. No need to delve further into the intricacies at this stage.⁣
- I like how you can filter by tag on the edabit challenges so I can specifically practice RegEx today.⁣
- Enjoying the extra challenge of refactoring my solutions into more efficient code (after viewing alternative solutions).⁣
- Looks like there are cool online tools to help construct your more complex RegEx patterns.⁣
- I'm quite enjoying RegEx.⁣
- Some of these regex look like the kind of thing you would see on the Predator's arm device.⁣
- Cool to see how edabit uses tests and you can see what they are. Guessing this is my first exposure to unit testing which I will cover at some point. Just seen test() is a method of the RegExp object.⁣
- Happy with what I've learned about RegEx (no need to go further at this stage) so will attack recursion tomorrow with the same approach: 30-60 mins reading on the subject then edabit challenges filtered by recursion.

### Day 75: 20/6/20 

**Today's Progress**
- Recursion - A function that calls itself inside of its own definition. Invoke the same function with a different input until you reach your base case (a conditional to prevent an infinite loop). Most loops can be rewritten in a recursive style and in some functional languages this approach to looping is the default. You need to remember that you won’t have just one call, you’ll have several nested calls
- edabit Very Easy recursion qs: 0% in 2 hours.
- arr.join("") - array to a string without commas.
- repeat() - method constructs and returns a new string which contains the specified number of copies of the string on which it was called, concatenated together.
- When writing recursive algo, don't try and break the problem down to the base case (that's the function's job) just think about the problem that is one step simpler than the problem you are really trying to solve, and then write your recursive algorithm to build up from there to solve the real problem.
- split, reverse, join = quick way to reverse string with built in methods.
- substr() method returns the characters in a string beginning at the specified location through the specified number of characters.

**Thoughts** 
- Started on Very Easy edabit recursion Qs to start from super simple and work my way up.
- Using chrome console to test and debug some answers. Strangely I'm getting different outputs than in edabit. 
- Discovered some cool online JS runtime envs (playcode.io) to play with code. My code works fine in here but not in edabit?!
- Checked solution after 1 hour to find 1 simple line of code. Lol. Still good practicing my problem solving and speaking JS skills. I'm actually glad I'm not checking resources tab. Even though it is taking me super long to get there, the process is really beneficial.
- Still avoiding the "math" tag for now to remove one extra thing to work out. 
- Starting to check resources to at least get my recursions working. I think I am struggling with scope doing bit my (inexperienced) way. Once I start to fly through with checking then I'll go back to not checking.
- I get the concept of recursion but they are quite fiddly. Especially setting up the recursive part of the code.
- Although I am struggling with executing recursion, I am still learning to work with more built-in methods.
- Still struggling to get my head around the nested inner workings and "unwinding" of recursion. Wondering if it's best to leave it as a "black-box" for now (get the function working, don't worry about HOW it works).

### Day OFF: 21/6/20 

**Today's Progress**
- N/A.

**Thoughts** 
- Reflections on the last week or so: 
- The edabit challenges have really boosted both my knowledge (especially of built in methods) and confidence. I'm building my problem solving muscle and can give most challenges a decent attempt. 
- At the start, I struggled with Very Easy and can see the progress I have made by being able to do most of the Easy ones. Will try a few medium next week.
- I'm finding a good balance of physical exercise = enough to keep me sharp, not too much it tires me out.
- Looking forward to the final few weeks of the challenge. Still enjoying the journey. Fully aware that although the challenge may end soon, the learning will never stop. Lucky I love learning.

### Day 76: 22/6/20 ⁣
⁣
**Today's Progress**⁣
- edabit Medium: 75% success in 2.5hrs.⁣
- Convert an Object to an Array - 3 variations: Object.keys Object.values Object.entries.⁣
- Rest parameter syntax - allows us to represent an indefinite number of arguments as an array.⁣
- arguments object - arguments is an Array-like object accessible inside functions that contains the values of the arguments passed to that function.⁣
- Array.from() - static method creates a new, shallow-copied Array instance from an array-like or iterable object.⁣
- Javascript is always pass by value. But because object references are values, objects will behave like they are passed by reference. ⁣
⁣
**Thoughts** ⁣
- Still not checking the resources but am googling. Am also noticing when I'm drafting my approaches on pen and paper I have a few options in the toolkit (now I know a few built-in methods).⁣
- A lot of these are easy if/when you know how. Knowledge of an appropriate built-in method is the difference between taking 30 mins to solve it and 30 seconds.⁣
- Doing well with the mediums (albeit I am skipping math, recursion and regex tags for now).⁣
- Good fun practising with objects and accessing certain parts of them. Last week or so has mainly been arrays.⁣
- Could do with some reduce() and map() practice, not used them much but see them about often.⁣
- I'm noticing my solutions are now often "better code" than most of the other submissions. And a couple of times it has been better than the most voted solution (imo)! Cool.⁣
- My loop game is lame. Added to "brush up" list.⁣
- Pass by value and reference - I get it in principle but will do some reading on what this actually entails with regard to memory, variables and issues you can run into in JS. Some basic computer science reading will help.⁣
⁣
**Questions**⁣
- Are you usually allowed to google when you do coding tests in interviews?

### Day 77: 23/6/20 

**Today's Progress**
- Memory and pass by value/reference reading. Understanding addresses and how the hardware/memory operates. By value copies the value into two separate spots in memory effectively making them entirely separate entities.
- edabit on Medium: 80% Success. 
- every() - method tests whether all elements in the array pass the test implemented by the provided function. It returns a Boolean value.
- Merging (sub) arrays - If you know you're dealing with arrays, use spread. But if you might be dealing with the possibility with a non-array, then use concat to merge.
- By making separate smaller functions we get the ability to use them again.
- reduce() - basically a loop with a memory.
- flat() - method creates a new array with all sub-array elements concatenated into it recursively up to the specified depth.

**Thoughts** 
- Still avoiding the resources tab. That won't always be there in real life.
- I managed to solve the pass by value/reference q I was stuck on yesterday in 2 minutes after my reading. I get it all a bit more and how to solve a few of the quirks.
- Another good day at the gym.

### Day 78: 24/6/20 ⁣
⁣
**Today's Progress**⁣
- edabit Loops on Very Easy - Success 100% Started off taking a while (good pun) to complete then reduced completion time rate to 5-10 mins.⁣
- += To remember which symbol comes first, remember it is called the "addition assignment". Add something to a variable and store the result in that variable.⁣
⁣
**Thoughts** ⁣
- I'm not googling or checking Resources tab so I can really get my head around writing my own loops from scratch. The conditional part is easy, it is knowing what to put in the executable code block I am struggling with atm.⁣
- for of and for in could do with a brush-up. Noticed I have no notes on these in my JS doc. Guessing edabit will have some challenges to practice.⁣
- for each, map and filter (potentially quicker alternatives to basic loops) could also do with a brush-up.⁣
- Interesting to see different loop methods have different performance times, albeit ms difference.⁣
- Somewhat embarrassing I can't do the most basic for loop but I know I'll learn it.⁣
- Again, tutorial hell shows that you can get far down the line of development but not know some of the most basic fundamentals.⁣
- Glad I dropped to Very Easy and built up the loop muscle instead of moving to Hard. Would have meant I still wound't have the loop muscle going forward and that would have caught up with me.⁣
- Keep getting caught out by using I instead of arr[i] when trying to move array items.⁣
- Getting the hang of basic loops now. Time per q is dropping significantly. Can do more work with optimising though especially using arrow functions and map etc.⁣
- A humbling day at the gym. But much needed.

### Day 79: 24/6/20 ⁣
⁣
**Today's Progress**⁣
- Application-level state management reading - If the app gets too big and you are passing state 5 components deep (prop drilling) then use application state (Redux, useContext, MobX etc). Looking at options available and rough pros and cons of each.⁣
- Redux - works on the simple principle of storing the entire state of the application is a single central store. This store can be accessed by all components and as such, removes the need to pass parameters and properties between components. The main building blocks of Redux are its actions, reducers, and store.⁣
- React Context API and hooks - Context API: A clean and easy way to share state between components (without having to pass props down all of the time). Hooks: tap into the inner workings of React in functional components. These 2 combined = redux-like state management magic.⁣
⁣
**Thoughts** ⁣
- Chat with mentor @voyzan yesterday and plotted the next steps for the coming weeks. @dev.jeanrauwers helped with some input.⁣
- Although I may not need state management with what I personally am building, I feel having some basic knowledge would help if I work with a codebase that utilises some form of application-level state. Watched a few vids, took some notes then moved on to React Context and Hooks.⁣
- More of a planning and prioritization day today, not so much learning. It will mean though that I am learning the "right things for me at this time" instead of learning other things which I may not need at this stage.

### Day 80: 26/6/20 ⁣
⁣
**Today's Progress**⁣
- React State Management Tutorial - DevEd tutorial using Context API and hooks.⁣
- Array.map - Method to map each item in an array to something else.⁣
- "Lifting up the state" - cutting state from original component and moving to parent. This makes state more accessible (to other components) but doesn't prevent "prop drilling" (passing props down through multiple component layers).⁣
- Context - creates a context component which can be passed however we want. Whole App gets wrapped in the Provider so all components that are wrapped get access to the state/info.⁣
Takes a while to set up but then you just import it and use it in whatever component you want.⁣
⁣
**Thoughts** ⁣
- Getting good at setting up React apps and syncing with GH.⁣
- Nice to be back in React. I can feel how when you leave something for a while you start to forget what you learnt, guess that's just how it is.⁣
- .map appearing again. Noted to get familiar with this and had a quick read up on it.⁣
- Understand context in theory and followed along ok but the finer details and setup not quite sunk in yet. It will come with practice. Cool concept though, can see how useful it is.
