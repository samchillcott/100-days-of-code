# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 31/3/20 Tuesday  

**Today's Progress**: I've got my head around the various ways of writing functions, the difference between expressions and declarations and how parameters and arguments interact with each other.

Basics, but I realised when doing a React tut recently I was following ok with the code (after all, you just copy essentially) but some sentences were going over my head so I decided to go back in on the terminology until I genuinely understood it

**Thoughts** I've prob already done around 100 hours of learning but excited to start this challenge. Also excited to get back to React with some solid JS fundamentals under my belt. I've always understood the meta concepts but now I get each part of the code a bit more

### Day 2: 1/4/20 Tuesday  

**Today's Progress**: Figured out all teh different ways to write functions. Leant how to convert functions to arrow functions (and revert).

**Thoughts** Glad I fully get this now. Name, parameters, statement, arguments all mean something to me now.

### Day 3: 2/4/20   

**Today's Progress**: ES6 Modules (Vanilla JS). Came across export default when using React and understood its function but not really the syntax - this seems to be a theme! Also looked at node.js module.exports.

**Thoughts** I knew going into frameworks would highlight some areas of JS I'd have to go back on so I'm glad I made notes while doing it (anything I didn't quite get while playing with React and Vue, I checked to see if it was Vanilla or the framework). Looking forward to getting back to React with this fundamental knowledge in place. Still a few (main) areas to go back to but will do them first.

### Day 4: 3/4/20   

**Today's Progress**: Classes, constructor functions, instances. The difference between objects and classes and what they are used for. Next week or so will be learning but will move back to tutorials and actual coding soon (what I was doing before I started the challenge).

**Thoughts** I now can see how OOP can be used in real life. Learning JS using online classes is cool but does sometimes lack the context of when and how the code would be useful. As with the last few days, I have had to backtrack a little but it's all good. It's lucky I love learning.

### Day 5: 4/4/20   

**Today's Progress**: Classes ctd using Codecademy. Inheritance, parent and child classes, super and extends keywords. Also went back and did Arrays section again as a refresher.

**Thoughts** I now can see how classes can save a lot of time and code = DRY. Another solid 3 hours of learning at the weekend. Love it.

### Day 6: 5/4/20   

**Today's Progress**: Getters and Setters. Didn't initially understand why we wouldn't just access the properties as usual but can now see the advantages of both and how they help with privacy/access etc. Also figured out why underscore was being used - naming convention to indicate the proprty shoudn't be altered

**Thoughts** Little tired today so only did an hour. Switched to less taxing learning and happy I still continued the streak. Also enjoying how whenever I dont 'get' something, I make a note, come back to it, do some research and within a day or so, I 'get' it. Reminds me not to get disheartened.

### Day 7: 6/4/20   

**Today's Progress**: 
- Factory functions - creating many instances of an object⁣
- Property value shorthand ⁣
- Destructuring - extracting key-value pairs from an object and assigning them to a variable⁣
- Browser compatibility - How some browsers cant work with ES6⁣
- Babel - a transpiler used to convert ES6 to ES5 to overcome above compatibility issues

**Thoughts** Good to finish off advanced objects section on Codecademy as this is where I got stuck when I first tried JS about 3 months ago. Confident I'll complete the course and comprehend most of it.

### Day 8: 7/4/20   

**Today's Progress**: 
Promises - My introduction to Asynchronous programming. An async operation is one that allows the computer to “move on” to other tasks while waiting for the asynchronous operation to complete.⁣
⁣
.setTimeout() - a Node API (a comparable API is provided by web browsers) that uses callback functions to schedule tasks to be performed after a delay. Has two parameters: a callback function and a delay in milliseconds.⁣
⁣
.then- a higher-order function— it takes two callback functions as arguments. We refer to these callbacks as handlers. When the promise settles, the appropriate handler will be invoked with that settled value.⁣
⁣
.catch() -  takes only one argument, onRejected. In the case of a rejected promise, this failure handler will be invoked with the reason for rejection. Using .catch() accomplishes the same thing as using a .then() with only a failure handler.⁣
⁣
Tip 1: Always go back an fill in your gaps of knowledge before you move on⁣
⁣
Tip 2: If at first you don't get a concept, stick with it until it clicks.⁣

**Thoughts** 
As with most of my JavaScript learning journey, I've understood the concepts pretty much right away but not always been able to fully comprehend the syntax. I now recognize that "annoyed/frustrated" feeling as part of the process and have proved to myself multiple times that after a couple of days, I finally get it.⁣
⁣
I was thinking of creating a measure called "Syntax Comprehension %" for myself.  I endeavour to understand what EVERY part of the code is doing in a particular block/section/concept.

### Day 9: 8/4/20   

**Today's Progress**: 
Promises - chaining and concurrency.⁣ Finished CA section.
⁣
- Chaining Multiple Promises - One common pattern we’ll see with asynchronous programming is multiple operations which depend on each other to execute or that must be executed in a certain order.⁣
⁣
This process of chaining promises together is called composition. Promises are designed with composition in mind. Promise composition allows for much more readable code than the nested callback syntax that preceded it.⁣
⁣
- Concurrency - To maximize efficiency we should use concurrency, multiple asynchronous operations happening together. With promises, we can do this with the function Promise.all().⁣

**Thoughts** 
I've been making notes on all the foggy areas and all the questions I have whilst working through the Codecademy Promises section and will consolidate that knowledge over the coming days before moving on to the next section.⁣ Glad I'm practicing what I preach.

### Day 10: 9/4/20   

**Today's Progress**: 
- Callback functions - spent today getting head around what the syntax does. ⁣
⁣
Be careful not to nest too many callbacks if you can help it, as this can lead to something called “callback hell”.⁣

**Thoughts** 
I plan to understand callbacks, then promises then async/await as that seems the logical order and that ties into when they were introduced into JavaScript as improvements on the previous iteration. I like my new approach of not bombing onto the next section without fully comprehending.

### Day 11: 10/4/20   ⁣
⁣
**Today's Progress**: Promises but nothing sticking and brain is not functioning properly due to lack of sleep. Started about 6 different videos but ended up staring blankly at the screen.⁣
⁣
Had a note to read about errors and handling (related to promises) so I read up on errors and the different types:⁣
- Syntax⁣
- Runtime⁣
- Logical⁣
- Latent ⁣
- Input/validation⁣
- Compilation⁣
⁣
**Thoughts** Don’t be afraid to switch to (unrelated) passive learning if you still want to use your study time. Keep it easy.  I switched to super passive note-taking so I can process properly over the coming days when my brain is back in the game. ⁣

### Day 12: 11/4/20   ⁣
⁣
**Today's Progress**: ⁣
- Execution context - an abstract concept of an environment where the Javascript code is evaluated and executed. Whenever any code is run in JavaScript, it’s run inside an execution context.⁣
- Execution Stack - helps the JavaScript engine to keep track of the order of execution.⁣
- Call stack - a data structure that uses the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle to temporarily store and manage function invocation (call).⁣
- Event Loop - has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, it will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it.⁣
- Web APIs - A set of functionalities that help us perform additional tasks that are difficult to be performed on the main (single) thread, provided by the browser.⁣
⁣
- I now understand what web APIs are and how they support the single thread JS runtime.⁣
- main resource - https://blog.sessionstack.com/how-javascript-works-event-loop-and-the-rise-of-async-programming-5-ways-to-better-coding-with-2f077c4438b5⁣
⁣
⁣
**Thoughts** ⁣
- Take care of your body/listen to your body. Wasn’t feeling 100% there mentally today so did some easy research and reading.⁣
- Catch and make notes of sentences/phrases/words you don’t really understand. These are ideal to tick off on days when you aren't fully charged.⁣
- I plan to do more CS stuff at some point to understand the workings of the machines. Helps to understand what is happening on a macro level.⁣

### Day 13: 12/4/20   

**Today's Progress**: 
- Node.JS - Learnt about what it is, where it is used and how it sits in terms of JS and popular stacks such as MEAN and MERN. By zooming out and looking at runtime environments, I understand the main use context for JS - something you don’t always get when learning via something like Codecademy. 
- I can also now see how Modules and npm now sit with JS and node so I have connected a few dots.
- Module is a file, package is a collection of files and has a package.JSON for the metadata that describes the file or directory)
- truthy falsy refresher - Mainly used to check if something is undefined, null etc Useful when writing conditionals.

**Thoughts** 
- Still had a low-level headache (possibly from hay fever) so took it easy again today. I’m still learning though and these “off topic” passive learning days often give aha moments. 
- I did consider having a day off/rest day but figured I’d do an hour and see how I felt.
- I’d like to become a full-stack dev at some point and am quite looking forward to trying some back end stuff.
- I know I haven’t done much “coding” (or building) since I started the challenge but will be getting back into it once I finish off CA and solidify some fundamentals.
