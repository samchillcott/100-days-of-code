# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 31/3/20 Tuesday  

**Today's Progress**: I've got my head around the various ways of writing functions, the difference between expressions and declarations and how parameters and arguments interact with each other.

Basics, but I realised when doing a React tut recently I was following ok with the code (after all, you just copy essentially) but some sentences were going over my head so I decided to go back in on the terminology until I genuinely understood it

**Thoughts** I've prob already done around 100 hours of learning but excited to start this challenge. Also excited to get back to React with some solid JS fundamentals under my belt. I've always understood the meta concepts but now I get each part of the code a bit more

### Day 2: 1/4/20 Tuesday  

**Today's Progress**: Figured out all teh different ways to write functions. Leant how to convert functions to arrow functions (and revert).

**Thoughts** Glad I fully get this now. Name, parameters, statement, arguments all mean something to me now.

### Day 3: 2/4/20   

**Today's Progress**: ES6 Modules (Vanilla JS). Came across export default when using React and understood its function but not really the syntax - this seems to be a theme! Also looked at node.js module.exports.

**Thoughts** I knew going into frameworks would highlight some areas of JS I'd have to go back on so I'm glad I made notes while doing it (anything I didn't quite get while playing with React and Vue, I checked to see if it was Vanilla or the framework). Looking forward to getting back to React with this fundamental knowledge in place. Still a few (main) areas to go back to but will do them first.

### Day 4: 3/4/20   

**Today's Progress**: Classes, constructor functions, instances. The difference between objects and classes and what they are used for. Next week or so will be learning but will move back to tutorials and actual coding soon (what I was doing before I started the challenge).

**Thoughts** I now can see how OOP can be used in real life. Learning JS using online classes is cool but does sometimes lack the context of when and how the code would be useful. As with the last few days, I have had to backtrack a little but it's all good. It's lucky I love learning.

### Day 5: 4/4/20   

**Today's Progress**: Classes ctd using Codecademy. Inheritance, parent and child classes, super and extends keywords. Also went back and did Arrays section again as a refresher.

**Thoughts** I now can see how classes can save a lot of time and code = DRY. Another solid 3 hours of learning at the weekend. Love it.

### Day 6: 5/4/20   

**Today's Progress**: Getters and Setters. Didn't initially understand why we wouldn't just access the properties as usual but can now see the advantages of both and how they help with privacy/access etc. Also figured out why underscore was being used - naming convention to indicate the proprty shoudn't be altered

**Thoughts** Little tired today so only did an hour. Switched to less taxing learning and happy I still continued the streak. Also enjoying how whenever I dont 'get' something, I make a note, come back to it, do some research and within a day or so, I 'get' it. Reminds me not to get disheartened.

### Day 7: 6/4/20   

**Today's Progress**: 
- Factory functions - creating many instances of an object⁣
- Property value shorthand ⁣
- Destructuring - extracting key-value pairs from an object and assigning them to a variable⁣
- Browser compatibility - How some browsers cant work with ES6⁣
- Babel - a transpiler used to convert ES6 to ES5 to overcome above compatibility issues

**Thoughts** Good to finish off advanced objects section on Codecademy as this is where I got stuck when I first tried JS about 3 months ago. Confident I'll complete the course and comprehend most of it.

### Day 8: 7/4/20   

**Today's Progress**: 
Promises - My introduction to Asynchronous programming. An async operation is one that allows the computer to “move on” to other tasks while waiting for the asynchronous operation to complete.⁣
⁣
.setTimeout() - a Node API (a comparable API is provided by web browsers) that uses callback functions to schedule tasks to be performed after a delay. Has two parameters: a callback function and a delay in milliseconds.⁣
⁣
.then- a higher-order function— it takes two callback functions as arguments. We refer to these callbacks as handlers. When the promise settles, the appropriate handler will be invoked with that settled value.⁣
⁣
.catch() -  takes only one argument, onRejected. In the case of a rejected promise, this failure handler will be invoked with the reason for rejection. Using .catch() accomplishes the same thing as using a .then() with only a failure handler.⁣
⁣
Tip 1: Always go back an fill in your gaps of knowledge before you move on⁣
⁣
Tip 2: If at first you don't get a concept, stick with it until it clicks.⁣

**Thoughts** 
As with most of my JavaScript learning journey, I've understood the concepts pretty much right away but not always been able to fully comprehend the syntax. I now recognize that "annoyed/frustrated" feeling as part of the process and have proved to myself multiple times that after a couple of days, I finally get it.⁣
⁣
I was thinking of creating a measure called "Syntax Comprehension %" for myself.  I endeavour to understand what EVERY part of the code is doing in a particular block/section/concept.

### Day 9: 8/4/20   

**Today's Progress**: 
Promises - chaining and concurrency.⁣ Finished CA section.
⁣
- Chaining Multiple Promises - One common pattern we’ll see with asynchronous programming is multiple operations which depend on each other to execute or that must be executed in a certain order.⁣
⁣
This process of chaining promises together is called composition. Promises are designed with composition in mind. Promise composition allows for much more readable code than the nested callback syntax that preceded it.⁣
⁣
- Concurrency - To maximize efficiency we should use concurrency, multiple asynchronous operations happening together. With promises, we can do this with the function Promise.all().⁣

**Thoughts** 
I've been making notes on all the foggy areas and all the questions I have whilst working through the Codecademy Promises section and will consolidate that knowledge over the coming days before moving on to the next section.⁣ Glad I'm practicing what I preach.

### Day 10: 9/4/20   

**Today's Progress**: 
- Callback functions - spent today getting head around what the syntax does. ⁣
⁣
Be careful not to nest too many callbacks if you can help it, as this can lead to something called “callback hell”.⁣

**Thoughts** 
I plan to understand callbacks, then promises then async/await as that seems the logical order and that ties into when they were introduced into JavaScript as improvements on the previous iteration. I like my new approach of not bombing onto the next section without fully comprehending.

### Day 11: 10/4/20   ⁣
⁣
**Today's Progress**: Promises but nothing sticking and brain is not functioning properly due to lack of sleep. Started about 6 different videos but ended up staring blankly at the screen.⁣
⁣
Had a note to read about errors and handling (related to promises) so I read up on errors and the different types:⁣
- Syntax⁣
- Runtime⁣
- Logical⁣
- Latent ⁣
- Input/validation⁣
- Compilation⁣
⁣
**Thoughts** Don’t be afraid to switch to (unrelated) passive learning if you still want to use your study time. Keep it easy.  I switched to super passive note-taking so I can process properly over the coming days when my brain is back in the game. ⁣

### Day 12: 11/4/20   ⁣
⁣
**Today's Progress**: ⁣
- Execution context - an abstract concept of an environment where the Javascript code is evaluated and executed. Whenever any code is run in JavaScript, it’s run inside an execution context.⁣
- Execution Stack - helps the JavaScript engine to keep track of the order of execution.⁣
- Call stack - a data structure that uses the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle to temporarily store and manage function invocation (call).⁣
- Event Loop - has one simple job — to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, it will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it.⁣
- Web APIs - A set of functionalities that help us perform additional tasks that are difficult to be performed on the main (single) thread, provided by the browser.⁣
⁣
- I now understand what web APIs are and how they support the single thread JS runtime.⁣
- main resource - https://blog.sessionstack.com/how-javascript-works-event-loop-and-the-rise-of-async-programming-5-ways-to-better-coding-with-2f077c4438b5⁣
⁣
⁣
**Thoughts** ⁣
- Take care of your body/listen to your body. Wasn’t feeling 100% there mentally today so did some easy research and reading.⁣
- Catch and make notes of sentences/phrases/words you don’t really understand. These are ideal to tick off on days when you aren't fully charged.⁣
- I plan to do more CS stuff at some point to understand the workings of the machines. Helps to understand what is happening on a macro level.⁣

### Day 13: 12/4/20   

**Today's Progress**: 
- Node.JS - Learnt about what it is, where it is used and how it sits in terms of JS and popular stacks such as MEAN and MERN. By zooming out and looking at runtime environments, I understand the main use context for JS - something you don’t always get when learning via something like Codecademy. 
- I can also now see how Modules and npm now sit with JS and node so I have connected a few dots.
- Module is a file, package is a collection of files and has a package.JSON for the metadata that describes the file or directory)
- truthy falsy refresher - Mainly used to check if something is undefined, null etc Useful when writing conditionals.

**Thoughts** 
- Still had a low-level headache (possibly from hay fever) so took it easy again today. I’m still learning though and these “off topic” passive learning days often give aha moments. 
- I did consider having a day off/rest day but figured I’d do an hour and see how I felt.
- I’d like to become a full-stack dev at some point and am quite looking forward to trying some back end stuff.
- I know I haven’t done much “coding” (or building) since I started the challenge but will be getting back into it once I finish off CA and solidify some fundamentals.

#100DaysOfCode [14/100]⁣
⁣
### Day 14: 13/4/20   ⁣
⁣
**Today's Progress**⁣
- Promises - Read all my collated notes from the last few days and it is starting to make more sense.⁣
- Redid the Promises section on CA then got stuck at where an executor function sits with promises.⁣
- Main resource - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QO4NXhWo_NM⁣
⁣
**Thoughts** ⁣
- The “take it easy” learning I did over the last 2 days has helped me visualise what is happening in asynchronous programming so going back to the code, It makes way more sense as I can visualise “where” each part is going to/from.⁣
- Taking it steady mentally and physically and a good night’s sleep has fully recharged me and my focus for the week ahead. Listen to your body. ⁣
- I’m starting to see a theme in how I learn and the difference between understanding the abstract/meta concept (what is going on and why), the terminology(the words used to describe what is going on) and the syntax (used to execute the concept).

### Day 15: 14/4/20   ⁣
⁣
**Today's Progress**⁣
- Promises redo in CA - Making more sense than my initial run but still lots of questions (which I am making a note of).⁣
- Found a few videos that explained it visually which is what I needed.⁣
- .then placement - I was getting confused as to why sometimes .then would be tagged immediately after the main function and sometimes on the next line. Turns out both work, the latter making the code more readable. I initially thought these were utilizing different ways to use .then.⁣
- Tip - always make a note of parts of the course you don’t really get. Then come back to them at a later date and you may be pleasantly surprised it makes sense after you have done some more practice or study.⁣
⁣
**Thoughts** ⁣
⁣
- I’m sure promises could be better explained with animations (not just graphics or drawing arrows on whiteboards) but I can’t seem to find any anywhere. I kinda get what each part is doing individually but not how they all interact with each other and in what order (constructor, executor, promise, then, catch). ⁣
- I’m starting to get bored and frustrated with Promises. So tempted to move on to the next stage (async-await) or do something related instead. ⁣
- Think I will move on to Async Await and Requests soon so I can get some experience actually using Promises and AA (learning in context). I know a large amount of front end work can be about APIs and making requests (consuming promises) so I think the sooner I start actually playing with it, the quicker I can see the concept in action and learn it that way. If not, I can always roll back to the basics.⁣
- This is my first real “brick wall” that I have stayed to try and climb. The feeling sucks.

### Day 16: 15/4/20   

**Today's Progress**
- Promises - tried a few videos coding along and using the console. Still don’t really get what part is connecting to where, and why.
- reject and resolve when used in the promise constructor aren’t JS keywords, just a naming convention. I think that was where I was getting confused as the names of the functions kept changing and the lack of consistency threw me a little. One of my most used questions while learning JS is “Where is that coming from?”.
- CA Requests - decided to have a quick look to see if it helps to play with promises using real world examples.

**Thoughts** 
- As an HSP, tutorials with loud key banging irritate me.
- I’m really starting to get frustrated (and angry if I’m honest) but I know that’s part of the game. I’m just acknowledging it.
- I said yesterday I am “hitting a brick wall” and my friend, Alfred, said to  “define the brick wall as a specific question that could be answered specifically” so I have started to make a list. There are quite a few.
- I get why setTimeout is used in examples to show/create async but that syntax adds a layer (and a load of brackets) of confusion. Surely real world examples would be better?

### Day 17: 16/4/20   

**Today's Progress**
- Promises - Starting to see the wood from the trees. I think realising the split between promise creation and promise consumption helps. And knowing consuming APIs means you don’t have to create the promise just consume it.
- Async Await - Been saving this until I ‘get’ promises but it appeared in a tut and can see how it works. AA doesn't really change anything in the background, it still uses promises, it's just an easier way to write asynchronous code as synchronous = syntactic sugar.

**Thoughts** 
- I’m glad I’m sticking at it. I explained this to my work wife as “I know all the pieces of the jigsaw, I just don’t know how they fit together”. Today I fit a few of them together and realised I was previously trying to connect two pieces that were part of the same puzzle but didn’t fit together.
- The importance of having a mentor (or at least someone who can talk you through a concept or code) - I spent 2 hours going through Promises from scratch with @voyzan and now I am really starting to fit the jigsaw puzzle pieces together. Without that support I probably would have either spent another 3-4 days on it or moved onto another area. Don’t be afraid to “call in the big guns” if you can’t work it out yourself. 
- I am super grateful for all those who have offered support since I started this journey.

### Day 18: 17/4/20   

**Today's Progress**
- Promises - I’m slowly consolidating all yesterday’s learning and creating a simple guide so I can explain it to myself and others (the rubber duck technique).
- Constructing a promise - pretty much got this part now. Consuming is what I’ll figure next.

**Thoughts** 
- I don’t know if it is just how my brain works but this could have been explained way better by separating all the components of promises (creating - executor, promise object, and consuming - then catch etc), explaining how each part works individually then how they all interact with each other and in what order. Nothing I read/watched really did it this way., it just made it way more complicated than I think it needs to be imo. Separate the parts, put them in order.
- I woke up with a bit of a headache (which is rare for me) and my brain isn’t functioning at all today. I’m looking at the screen but nothing is going in, let alone comprehending it. My mental energy is low. Good sleep will sort me out I know. I have all my jigsaw pieces, just didn’t have the ability to play jigsaw today.

### Day OFF: 18/4/ 20  

**Today's Progress**
-N/A

**Thoughts** 
- This is the first full day off with no coding/learning in 2 months straight (including weekends). I’ve been managing ok just doing on average 2-3 hours per day but have had a few headaches lately which I misdiagnosed as hay fever or sunburn. My body (and a few friends and family) has been telling me to give it a break for a day or so. Today I actually did that and it feels good. Much needed. 
- Woke up with no alarm, walk in nature, no screens until I made a few zoom calls. Will chill for the rest of the evening.
- I wanted to do an entry because these days are still part of the process and sometimes get overlooked.
- I may even plan them going forward or keep powering through and listen to the signals more instead of ignoring them and thinking “I’ll just do this one last thing”.

### Day OFF: 19/4/20   

**Today's Progress**
- N/A

**Thoughts** 
- Another day off due to mild headache still. Realised it was from stress after I spotted a few other symptoms. Did a meditation where I named the emotion as overwhelm. There is so much to learn when it comes to programming. It’s an eagerness and impatience rather than dread or doubt. The pressure I have put on myself is showing up in my body/brain.
- Identify your cause of stress and acknowledge it. Don’t resist, surprises or fight the emotion.

### Day 19: 20/4/20   ⁣
⁣
**Today's Progress**⁣
- Objects and Classes - Had a chat with my mentor and decided to go back over some other fundamentals. Started using Khan Academy’s Intro to Objects.⁣
- The difference between initialisation and instantiation. Instantiation is where an object (class instance) is created, Initialisation is when you provide an initial value for a variable. ⁣
**Thoughts** ⁣
- I’m going to leave Promises for now and will come back to it shortly. I think I’m probably missing the “obvious” because there are a few gaps in my fundamentals - both in terms of concepts and terminology. I think when I come back to it, it will probably click.⁣
- I can definitely see the benefit of learning in a traditional setting (such as a school/bootcamp) as you have a route/syllabus and people on hand to answer any qs you have at the time. Learning online/solo can mean you skip over or miss bits more often unless you are hyper-aware and diligent.⁣
- I’m relaxing a little more in terms of pressure to “bag the hours” in a day.⁣
- Switching from 60-minute pomodoros to shorter sprints of 25-30 so I still do the same number of hours but have more breaks in between which is more sustainable.⁣
- I like the KA approach as it is the happy medium between Codecademy and YT tuts where you get exercises but also verbal explanations. It’s cool try different (styles of) resources as they all explain it different ways and some may click more than others depending on your learning style.⁣
- Called it a day after 2 hours (4x30 mins). I could do more but easing back into it.

### Day 20: 21/4/20   ⁣
⁣
**Today's Progress**⁣
- Classes - Refresher on the 2 ways to define a class: class keyword and .prototype⁣
- Prototype (and how it sits with JS Classes) - Came across this a while back and knew I would go deeper at some stage. ⁣
- JS classes (introduced in ES6/2015) are syntactical sugar over JS’ prototype-based inheritance.⁣
- JS is object-oriented rather than class-based⁣
⁣
**Thoughts** ⁣
- OOP - I’ve covered a few areas of OOP and how it is used In JS and now I’m starting to connect a few dots and it is all slowly starting to click.⁣
- Pomodoros - Enjoying the new 30 min sprints.

### Day 21: 22/4/20   ⁣
⁣
**Today's Progress**⁣
- Constructor function - consolidated my notes and now comprehend what it does and where it sits with classes (and promises - which I will revisit soon). Also figured out how this gets used in a constructor: “The name property of this object is equal to whatever gets passed into the constructor function” (the argument passed in is the value/second part of the key-value pair). ⁣
- Object Inheritance + prototype chain - first look. Will go in over the next day or so.⁣
⁣
**Thoughts** ⁣
- I’m feeling strangely scared of returning to promises because I know if it still doesn’t click, I’ll get pissed off again. Kind of a dilemma - to progress to AA and requests I will have to go at promises again but if I do and I get annoyed again, I’ll lose motivation and momentum (albeit temporarily).⁣
- I wish I would have started with FreeCodeCamp from day 1. Hindsight is a wonderful thing but although CA looks aesthetically cooler and the free version (without the projects) can probably be completed quicker (after all it is an “Introduction to” JS), FCC does seem more comprehensive and complete.

### Day 22: 23/4/20   

**Today's Progress**
- Prototype - more learning on what they are.
- When to use prototype - If you plan to have more than one object that will share a method, you should place that method(s) on a prototype of those objects (general rule)
- Why use prototype - 1. DRY coding - not repeating the method across multiple objects 2. Ability to manipulate a single object for multiple instances (make a change and affect several objects at once). 3. Reduce memory requirements.
- Array methods - I now know why these methods are accessible (built-in) because each new array is a new instance of Array which has access to the Array.prototype.

**Thoughts** 
- Going somewhat off topic but prototypical inheritance is the basis of JS and it was on my list of things to learn anyway.
- Having a better understanding of creating objects/instances will help me when I go back to promises.
- I rested well yesterday and feel almost human again. I think the stress was preventing me catching up on my sleep debt.
