# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: 31/3/20 Tuesday  

**Today's Progress**: I've got my head around the various ways of writing functions, the difference between expressions and declarations and how parameters and arguments interact with each other.

Basics, but I realised when doing a React tut recently I was following ok with the code (after all, you just copy essentially) but some sentences were going over my head so I decided to go back in on the terminology until I genuinely understood it

**Thoughts** I've prob already done around 100 hours of learning but excited to start this challenge. Also excited to get back to React with some solid JS fundamentals under my belt. I've always understood the meta concepts but now I get each part of the code a bit more

### Day 2: 1/4/20 Tuesday  

**Today's Progress**: Figured out all teh different ways to write functions. Leant how to convert functions to arrow functions (and revert).

**Thoughts** Glad I fully get this now. Name, parameters, statement, arguments all mean something to me now.

### Day 3: 2/4/20   

**Today's Progress**: ES6 Modules (Vanilla JS). Came across export default when using React and understood its function but not really the syntax - this seems to be a theme! Also looked at node.js module.exports.

**Thoughts** I knew going into frameworks would highlight some areas of JS I'd have to go back on so I'm glad I made notes while doing it (anything I didn't quite get while playing with React and Vue, I checked to see if it was Vanilla or the framework). Looking forward to getting back to React with this fundamental knowledge in place. Still a few (main) areas to go back to but will do them first.

### Day 4: 3/4/20   

**Today's Progress**: Classes, constructor functions, instances. The difference between objects and classes and what they are used for. Next week or so will be learning but will move back to tutorials and actual coding soon (what I was doing before I started the challenge).

**Thoughts** I now can see how OOP can be used in real life. Learning JS using online classes is cool but does sometimes lack the context of when and how the code would be useful. As with the last few days, I have had to backtrack a little but it's all good. It's lucky I love learning.

### Day 5: 4/4/20   

**Today's Progress**: Classes ctd using Codecademy. Inheritance, parent and child classes, super and extends keywords. Also went back and did Arrays section again as a refresher.

**Thoughts** I now can see how classes can save a lot of time and code = DRY. Another solid 3 hours of learning at the weekend. Love it.

### Day 6: 5/4/20   

**Today's Progress**: Getters and Setters. Didn't initially understand why we wouldn't just access the properties as usual but can now see the advantages of both and how they help with privacy/access etc. Also figured out why underscore was being used - naming convention to indicate the proprty shoudn't be altered

**Thoughts** Little tired today so only did an hour. Switched to less taxing learning and happy I still continued the streak. Also enjoying how whenever I dont 'get' something, I make a note, come back to it, do some research and within a day or so, I 'get' it. Reminds me not to get disheartened.

### Day 7: 6/4/20   

**Today's Progress**: 
- Factory functions - creating many instances of an object⁣
- Property value shorthand ⁣
- Destructuring - extracting key-value pairs from an object and assigning them to a variable⁣
- Browser compatibility - How some browsers cant work with ES6⁣
- Babel - a transpiler used to convert ES6 to ES5 to overcome above compatibility issues

**Thoughts** Good to finish off advanced objects section on Codecademy as this is where I got stuck when I first tried JS about 3 months ago. Confident I'll complete the course and comprehend most of it.

### Day 8: 7/4/20   

**Today's Progress**: 
Promises - My introduction to Asynchronous programming. An async operation is one that allows the computer to “move on” to other tasks while waiting for the asynchronous operation to complete.⁣
⁣
.setTimeout() - a Node API (a comparable API is provided by web browsers) that uses callback functions to schedule tasks to be performed after a delay. Has two parameters: a callback function and a delay in milliseconds.⁣
⁣
.then- a higher-order function— it takes two callback functions as arguments. We refer to these callbacks as handlers. When the promise settles, the appropriate handler will be invoked with that settled value.⁣
⁣
.catch() -  takes only one argument, onRejected. In the case of a rejected promise, this failure handler will be invoked with the reason for rejection. Using .catch() accomplishes the same thing as using a .then() with only a failure handler.⁣
⁣
Tip 1: Always go back an fill in your gaps of knowledge before you move on⁣
⁣
Tip 2: If at first you don't get a concept, stick with it until it clicks.⁣

**Thoughts** 
As with most of my JavaScript learning journey, I've understood the concepts pretty much right away but not always been able to fully comprehend the syntax. I now recognize that "annoyed/frustrated" feeling as part of the process and have proved to myself multiple times that after a couple of days, I finally get it.⁣
⁣
I was thinking of creating a measure called "Syntax Comprehension %" for myself.  I endeavour to understand what EVERY part of the code is doing in a particular block/section/concept.
